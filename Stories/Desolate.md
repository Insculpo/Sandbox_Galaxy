## Desolate

*Written back in Jan 20th, 2015*

Living in the desolate, windy grey wastelands of a world where the sky is perpetually black, even when the sun shines as the brightest star in the sky has made me loose myself.  I am not sure how I got onto this world, what it is named or why I am here.  All I know is what I see.  I see sphere of stars that surround me, of uncountable amounts.  I tried to count them, believe me, I had all the flow of existence to do so.  I counted at least seventy six thousand, yet I kept losing track so I am certain that this number is completely off.  I am not bothered by that, for I also see myself.  My appendages are thick and stiff, why I assume they are is beyond me.  I can only feel like they are thick and stiff in comparison to something else’s appendages.   

Or someone else.   

I would have to assume maybe on another rock like mine that another being like me is counting the stars and trying to understand things.  I can’t say for certain, I never left this spherical rock.  I say spherical rock because I sometimes see other rocks in the sky, of which like the rock I am on is grey or some other shade of grey.  I have walked in a straight line on some occasions, my marks in the ground making it easy for me to keep track of where I have travelled on this world.  I eventually find myself in the same place, not sure how long it takes as I never try keeping track.  I simply try to count my steps, of which numbered around four million and sixty seven.  I am not sure why I was able to count all those steps, but I did just fine.  It took a while, that being said. 

One of my favorite as times is throwing rocks at the rocks in the sky.  When I fling a rock, it goes so far that I usually never see it again.  I tried throwing myself off the spherical rock I am on, but I always land back on it.  I wish I could fall off this rock sometimes, mainly so I can explore another rock.  I want to see what the other rocks are like.  Maybe they are of different color, or of different hardness.  Maybe some of them are bigger than the one I am on.  They could be all sorts of sizes, maybe as big as all the stars in the sky!   

I will admit, I do not believe I am alone on this rock.  The winds whisper to me frequently.  I sometimes believe myself to have heard a voice that wants to tell me about its own rock, but I never am able to reply.  If the winds really are talking to me, they must not like me much if they just whisper on by.   Sometimes I wonder if the wind is me.  I rebuke that idea by simply looking at a strange rock I found that allowed me to see myself.  I turned out to be the prettiest, most beautiful thing there is.  I had a mess of spherical components, curved in such perfect ways.  Every bend, every curve.  The interlocking nets that made up my body, my thick appendages loosely attached to my body.  I couldn’t imagine anything more beautiful than me.   

Except perhaps a copy of myself. 

Sometimes, using my appendages I try to dry myself.  Frustrating I found it, my etchings in the ground simply being too crude to make a perfect copy of myself.  I kept trying to make a copy of myself, making thousands of etchings all over my rock.  I slowly got better with my etchings, but never was I able to make what I wanted to make: A perfect replica of myself.  Eventually I covered too much of the once serene landscape I have been on as long as I can remember.  I mutilated the landscape with my crude illustrations, everywhere vastly inferior copies of me.   

It disgusted me after some time, I came to despise my own illustrations.  I missed when the landscape wasn’t ruined by my delusional ideas, when it was clean and full of potential.  Now the landscape is permanently covered in thousands of crude illustrations of myself, everywhere I looked.  I eventually snapped, immediately trying to erase the copies by sifting the dust over the markings.  The task proved arduous as I tried to take care to bring the landscapes back to their original appearance, before I molested them with myself.  I am not sure how long it took to remove all my crude copies of myself, but once I did I felt at peace once more.   

Or so I believed. 

As some time after I erased the copies of myself, I realized that my erasing of the crude copies had been similarly crude.  Everywhere I went I say marks of me, my long treaded feet leaving constantly more tracks everywhere I went.  Why, I begun to notice that by simply moving I ruined the landscape.  Ever since I tried walking around this rock I was ruining the serene, eternal landscape forever.  It horrified me when I realized that I forever will be hated by the planet, ignored by the wind and silently judged by others like me on the many other grey rocks that may be out there.  

Knowing now, that by doing anything at all I ruined my environment, I made the smart choice and stood silent as the land itself.
