### Overview

The Okar are filter feeders from an icy world towards the center of the galaxy, living through filtration of the radiation flux and building strings of radiation absorbing quasi-flora in the salt barrier zone 12 km below the surface.  They're a very slow thinking species, methodically building their global system and social patchwork, they view themselves as the weavers entrusted to chain the monsters of the abyss to the depths using their radiation farms.     They don't believe they have succeeded at this much because their chains decay too fast, so the efforts on their part are practically endless but they simply lack the resources to hold it up.  So predation issues continue for them.  The issues simply stack up for them as they can't communicate well and their society has been rather feudalistic for quite some time.  Endless feuding, frustration and stress pretty much defines their existence.  They hate working, but they must, or else they get devoured by the world underneath them.  Or so their myth goes (in all the truths it holds; there really are more busters who prey on them and building their nets keeps them less likely to predate upwards due to an aversion to radiation absorb any flora despite devouring creators who live off the radiation absorbent flora.
