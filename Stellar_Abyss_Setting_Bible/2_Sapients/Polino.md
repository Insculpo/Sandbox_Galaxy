### Overview

The Polino are a cold blooded native species from a world with a tropical environment and many volcanic islands in a shallow oceanic environment, who are mainly known for their filter feeding habits and nocturnal life style being mixed with a high degree of self awareness, coordination and collectivism which communally spreads throughout their species, with amazing peace within their species almost alien to the outside universe.  They have had some time periods of conflict- but all of it ended after they figured out sailing and violence just stopped for millennia to the point where none of their cultures used weaponry.  They like to feed on aero plankton currents which come out at night and have devised all matter of means which to capture, store and grow all matter of aero plankton on their world.  This allows them to live a pretty decent life style and never have they developed beyond a primitive life style due to a total lack of pressures to- being the top predator on their world and having little internal conflict enabled that.
