##Ikurmite

##Overview

The Ikurmites are from the icy world of Ikirma.  They had successfully regimented the depths to their will.  They are trapped in an endless Stone Age, but they're not aware of that as per usual.  They have managed amazing advancements despite that, ranging from pressure suits made from the flesh of creatures dragged down from above to even something that is equivalent to hydraulics.  They're aqua punk.   And in that environment, have made each hot spot a paradise.  And these clusters of hot spots are pretty stable, if rhythmic from the tidal flux the two moons provide.
