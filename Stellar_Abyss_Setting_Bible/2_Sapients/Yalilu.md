### Overview

The Yalilu are one of the few humanoids out there, a rather soggy one at that with a flat, salamander-like head adorned in a tentacle beard regardless of gender.  Their legs who had an iron age civilization dominating their world when discovered by the Ikeitans.  The Yalilu are one of the two main species the Ikeitos have adopted as their crew, which the Yalilu eagerly did as the Yalilu civilization that dominated the world (The Ecumenical Yalilu) did so with a fleet of ships that humans would compare to the dragon boats Koreans sailed with.  The Yalilu’s relationship with the Ikeitos is viewed as father and son instead of as mortal & god; for the Ecumenical Yalilu believed in a god of the sea as the Omni-lord of the cosmos.  

They assumed the Ikeitos to be one of god’s creatures of the cosmic realm.  The Yalilu’s belief in any god however would go poorly for them when the Ikeitos found out.  

The Ecumene rebelled against the order in its arrogance at these creatures and were horribly slaughtered.  The Yalilu were forced by the Ikeitos to dismantle all their temples to the one-and-only and those who refused were systemically wiped out while those who renounced their god were integrated to the Ikeitan fold.  The power of the Urzine Ikeitos, now in the open led to the submission of the world which traditionally had been so cowed by the Ecumene’s monopoly of the sea as rebellious provinces shifted to the Ikeitans in hopes of a better future which they partially got.  Still they have overlords, but at least they can travel the stars.  

Nowadays, centuries after their submission the Yalilu are part of the Ikeitos like cells in a body.  They go wherever Ikeitos go and repurpose themselves as whatever the Ikeitos see fit.  For instance, as a way to talk to humans.  The Yalilu have since spread to other factions, but remain mostly a Ikeitan client and often are seen together.
