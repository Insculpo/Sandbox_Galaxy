### Overview

The Phidians are a species whose origins are from a calcium rich, paste filled world.  They are deeply toxic to Terran life, despite being able to breathe similar air to us to the point where you could share a planet with them..  If it wasn't for how they tend to toxics regions of planets in their soupy chemicals and bleach-like sludge The intelligence of Phidians is highly debated, it varies a lot as their intelligence is very emergent from being in a group.  A Sapient Phidian has no real sense of self, instead they are in a perpetual state of atonal humming as they mosey about their world in ritual patterns.  Structures are made over time by them, many of which promote a range of alien concepts such as the Cindering, an ideology based around mutilation and hope from mutilation.  The state of hopeful harm, so to speak- mutilation is a highly sexual act for them, peeling and cracking being of deeply liberating of the core self-locked away by the confirms of natural laws- where rep fiction is a must, death must be feared and one must consume.  Active defiance of nature is a massive cultural drive of theirs, with a many zealotic Phidians fasting, risking their lives regularly and having sex for the sake of sex- not in the name of having children.  To live free is what they seek, by a definition quite distinctive from what we know of.  The Phidians are a highly non-material entity, who tend to only have a minority breeding (these breeders constitute a slave class which criminals are banished to- to the punishment of having to become pregnant!)
