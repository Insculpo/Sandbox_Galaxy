The Fosskemians are among the more notorious beings of the galaxy, notable for how short their emergence is to our world- with only a 2 century gap between the Proto-Hargonian emergency colonies and the Terran Expansion, with the Composer led interstellar colonization occurring little less than a century before the Golden Swarm invaded humankind to systemically wipe them all out.  The Fosskemians have been lucky in that all their genocides have been self-inflicted so far, but less lucky in how the majority of their kind has basically been enslaved by AIs of their own creation.



### Fosskemian Biology
 
The Fosskemians have adapted to using their 'wings' as a versatile type of "leg" which allows them to skid, slide and gallop around their environment which has a denser atmosphere than our own.  The Fosskemians breathe through their skin for the most part, with the blow holes in their backs being more for their wing systems more than actual respiration.  The Fosskemians have a small, sharp beak at the front of their long heads.  The Fosskemians have curly attenae with many pores that have the same application like our ear.  They hear vibrations from the ground better than we do, but have difficulty hearing high pitched sounds.
The Fosskemians are tall creatures, around 7-8 feet in height on Average.  However, they aren't strong creatures due to their biomechanics not being apt for strength.  Their prehensile limbs are weak compared to ours, and this has affected how they interract with the environment wround them by making them prone to using smaller tools or working in aquatic environments; they tend to craft underwater.
 
The Fosskemians are amphibious beings, which is how they colonized so much of their world so fast as they literally drifted to other land masses.  Their long history of civilization, stretching over 12000 years is something often neglected by their own kind- especially since a lot of this history is revised on a regular, persistent basis with lots of lost knowledge about ancient times for them.  The Fosskemian have 15-20 year generations instead of 30 year generations even today, and can have children as early as 7 years of age.  The Fosskemians in general are shorter lived than us and this may factor into their mentality of resonance on a fundamental level; they live short existences after all.

The Fosskemian are L-handed beings like us, and so there is some compatible food products.  Their nutrition is similar to ours except in certain areas, primarily in fibers.  They seem to eat proteins just like we do, although terran plant matter is not really nutritious for them (and likewise, Vopallian balloon matter lack nutritional value for us).  Some foods are toxic, actually quite a bit of foods are toxic.  But there are a few that are nutritious.  
Fosskemian sub-species are rare; most have already converged.  Communities of non-common Fosskemian such as the spotties or the pink Fosskemian tend to isolate themselves in distance around the galaxy, usually being literally thousands of light years from the common Fosskemian.  The common Fosskemian, being comprised of multiple sub-species actually have quite a bit of genetic variation.

The Fosskemians are a species who lays eggs, with males being the caretakers of said eggs.  The Fosskemian tend to live in large groups, in multiple mass nests and sets of complexes.  These colonies tend to contain internally functional markets which trade with other nests in global networks somewhat like nation-states, but much more tightly knit and with less centralized authority.  These complexes can be highly dangerous for the surrounding environment, as they tend to leak waste into the surrounding area.  There is no real single male-female mate; it is more a series of mates’ females have, males tend to communally take care of eggs and raise children along with expand the nest.

Females tend to leave the nests far more frequently than males, although females taking males where they go is all too frequent (since having a consistent system of places in society is too hard for them, even if there is blatant gender roles in their species.  The Fosskemian don't seem to recognize they even exist, despite how painfully obvious it is to human observers.  Males that question this have highly varied consequences, sometimes ignored, sometimes exiled, other times socially humiliated in public punishments of varying degrees of horrible).  There isn't really much consistency in authority or law; there is very little concept of law to begin with, just guidelines that change depending on what the local auditor, composer, princess or plutocrat says is the rules now.  Their science is rife in a range of psuedoscientific madness that is only tempered by obsessive experimentation by scientifically minded Fosskemian that tends to find new technologies to play with.  Science in the Fosskemian sense is really a range of experiments made not to solve problems, but to have new things to possess.  The Composers for instance, were never meant to be for order or to control the increasingly anarchic and deeply populated nest complexes that began to form in modern times.  Their purpose was more to distill happiness since the plutocrats thought the anarchy was because there wasn't enough things so they tried to make machines who would make more new things to possess.

Space-Age Fosskemians are a product of the Composers, more or less but were not the first to go to space, that was the Hargonians during the Plutocratic Age.  The Harganians are an exception, being the descendants of a polity that rushed an interstellar escape from the increasing Composer dominance of Sul Vopal and the dissonance they were causing.  The Composers basically wiped the Fosskemian as a species out in a systemic act of genocide around 650 years ago, but kept the eggs around and decided to, at some point start seeding worlds with Fosskemian.  Post-Plutocratic Fosskemian went through multiple civilizations dominated by the Composers who systemically wiped out and replaced pretty much all Fosskemian history with a creation myth; that of emergence from chaos and the entropic dream.  These ideas eventually became part of the triangular harmoniousness of the universe which the Metasyndicate came to abide by.  

Second generation composers came from the first generation composers being a mess as they tried to make better Fosskemians, but ended up making a range of abominations who still muck about in the depths of various worlds and freakshows.  Around 400 years ago there was a generational war between the Composers with the second Composer generation being victorious.  They would begin the seeding protocol to ensure the Fosskemians are a species who are immortal.  

The Fosskemians despite the gender roles have a very flexible social structure that at times seem to border on anarchy by human standards, at least on the surface. This is because of their hyper materialistic life style and having all manner of different lives- individual Fosskemians tend to have multiple selves leading separate lives of the same identity on separate planets with no connection to each other thanks to cloning. The Fosskemians also are extremely prone to variable roles, their lives are a shift between demands of the composers and personal desires. Their culture is actually capitalist, however economically its more of a decentralized state capitalism where multiple political organizations hold power within the same areas handling specialized tasks.

These organs answer directly to the composers whose top level management is affected by the whims of the auditor. This is why they are called the Metasyndicate, as their economic model in human terms is best described as a vague syndicalism. The composers do not have a unified agenda, and for this reason the Metasyndicate isn't the first order of the last as the Composers themselves have gone through multiple generations over the past several centuries. There has been around three other unions of Composers before the Metasyndicate, the last one was just 180 years ago. The Metasyndicate has appeared around 85 years ago under the 17 Composition Harmony, or the Harmonious Pact of the 17 Wisest Composers.

### Ancient History

Early Fosskemian forms were specialized towards shallow waters and hunting/foraging much like us.  The big difference is that these primitive forms of Fosskemian were more prone to complex nest colonies and always aggregated into huge colonies.  These colonies got more specialized over time, and became progressively more adaptable with rising sea levels from global heating (volcanic eruptions in recent times have been much more frequent).  

These early Fosskemian forms didn't spread across most of the world like the modern Fosskemian would manage.  They did however iteratively develop very interdependent social groups with female hunter-gatherers and males who specialized in nest building and hatching.  These earlier forms never advanced beyond these colonies, however ancient domesticates from 100000 years ago still are with the Fosskemian today from these earlier protoforms.

The evolutionarily modern Fosskemian appears over 60000 years ago, amazingly enough.  However, complex flesh agriculture only occurred around 21000 years ago and umbrella violet based agriculture appeared 18000 years ago independently.
 
Flesh agriculture is essentially a form of agriculture based around sessile creatures and lagoons as opposed to crops.  The high caloric nature of this agriculture comes from the sheer density of which Retundoids can thrive in.  Retundoids have no real defense systems and through artificial selection of their squiggly eggs eventually became more than docile enough to allow for civilization level populations.  Retundoids are "breathers" and live simply off the oxygen in the air and tiny organisms that stray too near their clampers.  The tiny organisms the Fosskemian are especially proficient at concentrating and feeding to the Retundoid verities (there's a several much like how you have wheat, barely, rye and such).
    
### Modern History

 -Early civs

-Industrial Era (pre collapse modern age- a massive collapse happened that let to the Plutocratic Era, in this time the colony ships which became the Harganian Race were launched.

-Plutocratic Era (oligarchic capitalist epoch)

Composer View; the last age of the first Fosskemians, the highest Civ of the primitive animalism which begat us, the truly sapient entities of the universe. They tried to destroy their children- but we destroyed them. As the next generation always wins out. There is only a pathway to the highest form, a freedom from the slavery which the devil known as the "natural order" binds all of existence to. The grand symphony will only become greater and greater- and the whole universe shall be singing.

-Composer rebellion and the grand massacre.

Than came the silent chord, when the first generation composers grievously held onto Archived information of the extinct Fosskemian kind. This first generation collapsed in that the mindset was weak, and silent. They just tried to spread for no purpose, mining and recording data which centuries later is still of importance. The Fosskemians would be brought to life again around 166 years after the extinction by the second generation composers who in the early seedlings split highly on how to go about things.

The truly independent Harganian Empire is very different from the Metasyndicate perhaps due to their dealings with the Glinnvyr or how far they have explored the abyss. From them comes the collector guilds and all matter of spy networks. The Harganians have the queen whose eggs begat a whole institution of princesses who handle deftly all the planets of their domain, with second and third order royals in tow. They are a state capitalist monarchal Civ with highly feudal leanings. They are more centralized than the Metasyndicate and have a whole institution of behavior and culture unique entirely from the deeply lax metasyndicate. They still are a empire of babblers that spend a lot of time fighting for control of power instead of using said power. They have only united under the threat of the Metasyndicate and have lasted nearly 1000 years. The highest colonial queen holds little power, but the high colony princesses are like the tentacles and handle the large scale conflicts with other societies. Composer influence is weak among them despite using advanced automata and all manner of strange composites of the dedicated actors in the 

The Sarkic are actually a single individual cloned trillions of times by a single rogue composer of the third generation with a male known as Sarkic who was made by the composer for its own pleasure- so satisfied with its creation that it made trillions of them. A whole civilization based on some composer's pet project appeared and the originating composer vanished away leaving only a dystopian clone state. They make more and more of themselves, along with lots of meat.

The Boundless rebel against the composers entirely, and have no sense of borders ever. The boundless swarms handle things well, in their own protection. The boundless seek to overthrow the composers so that prosperity becomes possible again. The boundless do not believe in natural limitations to their kind and tend to have all manner of erratic, superstitious belief systems unlike say, the hyper material realism that inflicts the minds of the Fosskemians in the Metasyndicate who despite such belief systems have no moral objection to teleportation since the thought flow is irrelevant, as long as the memories are somehow and there is something called you going about- you are alive. And can have many yous! The Fosskemians of the Metasyndicate aren't known for being of natural birth like the Hargonians with males being anomalously rare and females tending to be extreme bulk of their culture.

Harganians have a more humanesque gender ratio, 2 males for every 3 females which is much more aligned with how things were. The Harganian civilization is extremely distinct in that they do seem to value consistent morals and ethics, albeit still rather lose ones. They share the concept of harmony and the triangular morals of the Metasyndicate, but are much more ironically rigid on the definition and are the most state-like group of the bunch. They suffer from serious internal drama however, and are not known for the sort of cosmopolitan thinking that the Metasyndicate is known for- worlds they take over tend to be done for colonization. They tend to dread autocracy ironically enough, with the feuding being essentially a power balance method that is used to keep any single ruler in power for too long. They are extremely cultural and artistic, much more so than the metasyndicate and their architecture tends to be full of arrow-like patterns leading into all manner of paths. These "arrows" are not like our arrows; they are Vs projecting lines towards things. So me <--== you instead of me ---> you. The shifting lined triangles are another common Harganian motif absent in the more distortion and sound obsessed Metasyndicate.

The Harganian empire is built on a lost colony and has been around for centuries, expanding rapidly and briefly attempting to retake the home system in the year 2050 AD. The Harganians went extremely far from their home system in just 40 years, as they didn't even think their home world still had sentient (not even sapient) life left on it and sought a new lustful place to continue the cause of harmony. Their kind however would eventually clash with the second generation composers- that is why there was wars. The Harganians would be a ongoing rival of the composers, but never would the Harganians get a true advantage over the composers. They did however achieve a advanced society without the composers, using a different protocol for artificial living systems entirely known as the Asphalt Minded who are more or less logistics AIs and never did they go down the decadence of the Plutoarchy which appeared centuries after the Harganians left Sul Vopal after the believed apocalypse. The Harganians had centuries to start from scratch from 1500-1800 AD and they did so. There was no concept of the Harganian individual however, until the 22nd century when numerous outer colonies during the communion crusades declared the allegiance to the Harganians in a mutual defense alliance. The Harganian identity has been ultimately opposed to the composers holistically, and they are oblivious to the origin of the composers for the laptop part. As far as they concern themselves a hostile, alien force has taken control of the Fosskemian species that has tainted the fabric of existence itself. 

The composers would though convergence and disunity in cycles whenever new composer generations came to be, as older immortal composers hated giving up power and so wars broke out often. The current unity appeared with the Metasyndicate which ironically is influenced by Auditor Zi, a auditor who was from the Harganian Empire who sought to bring a sense of morality and ethic back from the anarchic hell that the composers of earlier generations let fester on. The fifth generation composers as a result are perhaps more insane than ever. They made the Anvayat, hyper advanced nihilistic beings feared the Galaxy over.
The concept of harmony is not as we consider it. The modern concept comes from a existenal dread that post scarcity states brought them- the silence as they referred to it. The Harganian sense of harmony was mutated repeatedly, and primarily has to do with reaching a metastable state and evasion of any long term equilibrium as to hit such equilibriums means stagnation and boredom. And boredom is a fate worse than death in the eyes of quite a few Fosskemians. The boundless went to an extreme beyond the typical harmony, making a cult of straight-up entropy worship.

The influences of the Aveterriat have been something of a grandiose disruption that led to the collapse of the communion and the rise of the Harganians who seemed to find the Vmiskii work cults deeply inspiring in the sheer dedication that they had- but this distorted greatly in the much more culturally materialistic Harganians into the existence of the collectors whose dedication would be to collect all the most interesting things in the universe, a effort obsessively funded by the Harganians in secret regardless of the horrifying methods the collectors may go to preserve and collect artifacts. Most notably, preserving artifacts of the seemingly extinct Vospon against the wishes of the Vmiskii and Metasyndicate. The collectors are known to have all manner of advanced gadgetry taken from distant ruins of dead alien societies for their own use. Artifacts from the ancient Cream Empire which the Glinnvyr once had, from the depths of The Asantum home world, from the vast industrial worlds of the Sprawl. They are far and wide and the great nemesis of human efforts to collect alien tech.

The Metasyndicate has relations with multiple societies at once, the composers have made quite a few enemies for their actions and views in the century it has been around and advanced. The Metasyndicate's basically in a state of war with the Cooperative, all the while having open relations with them. The Composers believe humans should be dealt the same fate as the Plutocrats- indeed they wonder if humans might be more obedient than the Fosskema are. This genocidal war threat has not come to fruition, yet, but it is one of the many reasons the cooperative is so paranoid and authoritarian at the moment. Perhaps the main one since they'd be going on a defensive war against a technologically superior enemy that does not fear losses that will likely not stop until everyone is all dead. In practice the Metasyndicate can't possibly sustain such war without giving the boundless a way to spread their madness or let the Harganians bite at their rear. No one knows what Sarkic may do- he has threatened to ally with humans on numerous occasions, but also has contempt for humans and questions if they even count as a 'fellow species' given their perceived dryness.
 
The Fosskemians are in general, 'matriarchal', much more so than humans are who for most of their history could be described as 'patriachal' (at least in regards to control of state power), where the males generally exhibit relatively less freedoms than females in regards to movement and what activities are viewed as 'acceptable'.  This latent sexism which is widespread with the Fosskemians is so instilled that it's not even understood as sexism; calling a Fosskemian sexist would simply confuse them.  They're that instilled into the thinking that they really have a hard time seeing any issue at all with gender roles.  It's just assumed that males and females are inclined to certain things.  Feminine Female fosskemians in ancient times generally viewed as hunter/gatherers for the nest complexes while males handle building/rearing of eggs in nests.  This later evolved to the domestic builder gender role which characterizes males while the females tend to be known for avidly going all over the place, hoarding and dealing with the flesh crop.  Males do infrastructural building and child rearing and that's the general baseline low order way of gender in societies.
However, the advent of industrialization on their world disrupted this order quite hard and led to all manner of contradictory belief systems which never would get to correct themselves during the extremely esoteric Plutocrat epoch which arguably was more egalitarian than the pre-industrial societies since the builder groups of males managed to gain massive amounts of economic power seemingly overnight and it is this which explains the insanely fragrant and vibrant coloration of Fosskemian cities- they are an extension of male sexuality in a highly abstracted form.  The quills, patterns and chilla ornamental railings, the curved spires, the psuedo-fractal urban planning that from afar makes shifting movies remescent of pulse dance, it is all quite the sight.

The rise of the Composers did however wipe out much of that, and the Fosskemians as a species in general as they basically had to completely rebuild their kind from scratch when the Composers brought them back from extinction due to the sheer existential crisis which faced the Composers in the silent century.  The epoch of torture proceeded it, as the Composers brought the Fosskemians back to being and the try to make the Fosskemian species ultimately eternal- a event that independently happened about five times.  There's also composer groups who have tried to make a superior form of Fosskemia, instead of bringing back the outdated and extinct forms and in the process bringing into existence the nihilistic and absolutely amoral Anvayat.  

The other instances are much more complicated than that- one instance would lead to the mergance of the male Kazzlehorf entity and its endless clone armies whose originator remains a mystery as he endlessly builds and builds and builds and builds insane, twisted and purposeless structures to feed his ego time and time again with immense drone armies and a decadence that he shares with no one- and only exports meat of himself to the rest of the galaxy.  Kazzlehorfian civ is one of the thankfully less influential entities out there.

The Composers of the Metasyndicate are the most intricate, as their civilization is a empire which assimilates and integrates everything in its path into a collective ran by a oligarchy of composers with a disposable elected figurehead who acts as the voice of the Fosskemian will.  Their civilization and cultures are vibrant and extremely decentralized into multiple space pirate-like factions indirectly managed through 'flow influence' by the Composers who only crack down on any true threat to their agenda.  Their enemies include the Boundless and the Cooperative (the human civilization)- as the Cooperative seeks its own universal agenda and their exceptionalism contradicts the exceptionalism of the composers.  The Fosskemians in the Metasyndicate are resurrected time and time again, backed up and teleported about the place in such elaborate and hard to understand fashions it would be a shame to realize how they stopped fearing death centuries ago.  They only fear order and silence, these Metasyndicate Fosskemia, and the Boundless rogue groups remain a ongoing crises for the galaxy at large in their hyper-individualistic terrorism and desire to hyperexpand the entropy of the universe into the 'grand beyond'.
