### Fosskemian Biology
 
The Fosskemians have adapted to using their 'wings' as a versatile type of "leg" which allows them to skid, slide and gallop around their environment which has a denser atmosphere than our own.  The Fosskemians breathe through their skin for the most part, with the blow holes in their backs being more for their wing systems more than actual respiration.  The Fosskemians have a small, sharp beak at the front of their long heads.  The Fosskemians have curly attenae with many pores that have the same application like our ear.  They hear vibrations from the ground better than we do, but have difficulty hearing high pitched sounds.
The Fosskemians are tall creatures, around 7-8 feet in height on Average.  However, they aren't strong creatures due to their biomechanics not being apt for strength.  Their prehensile limbs are weak compared to ours, and this has affected how they interract with the environment wround them by making them prone to using smaller tools or working in aquatic environments; they tend to craft underwater.
 
The Fosskemians are amphibious beings, which is how they colonized so much of their world so fast as they literally drifted to other land masses.  Their long history of civilization, stretching over 12000 years is something often neglected by their own kind- especially since a lot of this history is revised on a regular, persistent basis with lots of lost knowledge about ancient times for them.  The Fosskemian have 15-20 year generations instead of 30 year generations even today, and can have children as early as 7 years of age.  The Fosskemians in general are shorter lived than us and this may factor into their mentality of resonance on a fundamental level; they live short existences after all.

The Fosskemian are L-handed beings like us, and so there is some compatible food products.  Their nutrition is similar to ours except in certain areas, primarily in fibers.  They seem to eat proteins just like we do, although terran plant matter is not really nutritious for them (and likewise, Vopallian balloon matter lack nutritional value for us).  Some foods are toxic, actually quite a bit of foods are toxic.  But there are a few that are nutritious.  
Fosskemian sub-species are rare; most have already converged.  Communities of non-common Fosskemian such as the spotties or the pink Fosskemian tend to isolate themselves in distance around the galaxy, usually being literally thousands of light years from the common Fosskemian.  The common Fosskemian, being comprised of multiple sub-species actually have quite a bit of genetic variation.

The Fosskemians are a species who lays eggs, with males being the caretakers of said eggs.  The Fosskemian tend to live in large groups, in multiple mass nests and sets of complexes.  These colonies tend to contain internally functional markets which trade with other nests in global networks somewhat like nation-states, but much more tightly knit and with less centralized authority.  These complexes can be highly dangerous for the surrounding environment, as they tend to leak waste into the surrounding area.  There is no real single male-female mate; it is more a series of mates’ females have, males tend to communally take care of eggs and raise children along with expand the nest.

Females tend to leave the nests far more frequently than males, although females taking males where they go is all too frequent (since having a consistent system of places in society is too hard for them, even if there is blatant gender roles in their species.  The Fosskemian don't seem to recognize they even exist, despite how painfully obvious it is to human observers.  Males that question this have highly varied consequences, sometimes ignored, sometimes exiled, other times socially humiliated in public punishments of varying degrees of horrible).  There isn't really much consistency in authority or law; there is very little concept of law to begin with, just guidelines that change depending on what the local auditor, composer, princess or plutocrat says is the rules now.  Their science is rife in a range of psuedoscientific madness that is only tempered by obsessive experimentation by scientifically minded Fosskemian that tends to find new technologies to play with.  Science in the Fosskemian sense is really a range of experiments made not to solve problems, but to have new things to possess.  The Composers for instance, were never meant to be for order or to control the increasingly anarchic and deeply populated nest complexes that began to form in modern times.  Their purpose was more to distill happiness since the plutocrats thought the anarchy was because there wasn't enough things so they tried to make machines who would make more new things to possess.

Space-Age Fosskemians are a product of the Composers, more or less but were not the first to go to space, that was the Hargonians during the Plutocratic Age.  The Harganians are an exception, being the descendants of a polity that rushed an interstellar escape from the increasing Composer dominance of Sul Vopal and the dissonance they were causing.  The Composers basically wiped the Fosskemian as a species out in a systemic act of genocide around 650 years ago, but kept the eggs around and decided to, at some point start seeding worlds with Fosskemian.  Post-Plutocratic Fosskemian went through multiple civilizations dominated by the Composers who systemically wiped out and replaced pretty much all Fosskemian history with a creation myth; that of emergence from chaos and the entropic dream.  These ideas eventually became part of the triangular harmoniousness of the universe which the Metasyndicate came to abide by.  

Second generation composers came from the first generation composers being a mess as they tried to make better Fosskemians, but ended up making a range of abominations who still muck about in the depths of various worlds and freakshows.  Around 400 years ago there was a generational war between the Composers with the second Composer generation being victorious.  They would begin the seeding protocol to ensure the Fosskemians are a species who are immortal.  

The Fosskemians despite the gender roles have a very flexible social structure that at times seem to border on anarchy by human standards, at least on the surface. This is because of their hyper materialistic life style and having all manner of different lives- individual Fosskemians tend to have multiple selves leading separate lives of the same identity on separate planets with no connection to each other thanks to cloning. The Fosskemians also are extremely prone to variable roles, their lives are a shift between demands of the composers and personal desires. Their culture is actually capitalist, however economically its more of a decentralized state capitalism where multiple political organizations hold power within the same areas handling specialized tasks.

These organs answer directly to the composers whose top level management is affected by the whims of the auditor. This is why they are called the Metasyndicate, as their economic model in human terms is best described as a vague syndicalism. The composers do not have a unified agenda, and for this reason the Metasyndicate isn't the first order of the last as the Composers themselves have gone through multiple generations over the past several centuries. There has been around three other unions of Composers before the Metasyndicate, the last one was just 180 years ago. The Metasyndicate has appeared around 85 years ago under the 17 Composition Harmony, or the Harmonious Pact of the 17 Wisest Composers.

### Ancient History

Early Fosskemian forms were specialized towards shallow waters and hunting/foraging much like us.  The big difference is that these primitive forms of Fosskemian were more prone to complex nest colonies and always aggregated into huge colonies.  These colonies got more specialized over time, and became progressively more adaptable with rising sea levels from global heating (volcanic eruptions in recent times have been much more frequent).  

These early Fosskemian forms didn't spread across most of the world like the modern Fosskemian would manage.  They did however iteratively develop very interdependent social groups with female hunter-gatherers and males who specialized in nest building and hatching.  These earlier forms never advanced beyond these colonies, however ancient domesticates from 100000 years ago still are with the Fosskemian today from these earlier protoforms.

The evolutionarily modern Fosskemian appears over 60000 years ago, amazingly enough.  However, complex flesh agriculture only occurred around 21000 years ago and umbrella violet based agriculture appeared 18000 years ago independently.
 
Flesh agriculture is essentially a form of agriculture based around sessile creatures and lagoons as opposed to crops.  The high caloric nature of this agriculture comes from the sheer density of which Retundoids can thrive in.  Retundoids have no real defense systems and through artificial selection of their squiggly eggs eventually became more than docile enough to allow for civilization level populations.  Retundoids are "breathers" and live simply off the oxygen in the air and tiny organisms that stray too near their clampers.  The tiny organisms the Fosskemian are especially proficient at concentrating and feeding to the Retundoid verities (there's a several much like how you have wheat, barely, rye and such).

### Fosskemian Naming

**Rules**

-Nest and Personal name + all manner of appropriated nicknames.
-Simply a personal name and selected nicknames.  Names "evolve" with identity in various Fosskemian societies.
