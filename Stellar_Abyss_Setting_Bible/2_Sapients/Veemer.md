### Overview

The Veemer are phantom like sapients from the ice world [Lamsis](https://github.com/Insculpo/Sandbox_Galaxy/blob/Galactic/Stellar_Abyss_Setting_Bible/1_Worlds_Systems/Lamsis.md)
 who lived in the upper layers primarily, used to the cold and bathing in radiation, and are devilishly clever sapients.  The Veemer make use of two long prehensile tentacles to grab and flux about groups of critters in the upper layers while making huge settlements in the icy roof.  They are a very vivid, vocal bunch and their various cultures tend to show highly outwards attitudes to existence, though they are primitive and seem to know nothing on just how huge the universe is.  Indeed, they seem to see themselves as the height of their world and as a glorious species overall even in the millennia it took for them to even be where they are.  They are highly obsessed with status and authority, this shows everywhere with the personality cults all over the place and the general paradigm of migrating around the place while descending for the best harvests. Th Veemer never switched to full agriculture and hunting remains a huge aspect of their civilizations to this day, yet they have proven more than capable of developing the kind of high culture you find on many other worlds filled with sapient primitives
