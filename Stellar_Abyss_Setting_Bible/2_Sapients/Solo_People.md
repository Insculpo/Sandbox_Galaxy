### Overview

In the vein of time we have come across the solo people, who are of no collective and of no identity.  They are completely unfettered from form, concept or being.  Instead they are self aware nothingness.  The solo people are in effect Boltzmann brains whose culture is known because they make themselves known.  As that is how they are.  The solo people are what you have when nothing is creative, simply existing.
