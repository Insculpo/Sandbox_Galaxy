### Overview

Humans are 6’ tall bipeds who live on temperate, green plant-life worlds and require freshwater/oxygen.  Humans as a species are real, so this entry will focus on their status in the galaxy.  Humans are in comparison to the majority of other species who achieved interstellar travel and developed major space faring societies, upstarts.  While there are quite a few species who haven’t even left their planet, humans remain as relative new comers despite how rapid they have politically fractured.  Humans have managed to spread about anyways, for once free of Earth old human habits returned- such as the desire to move about vast places for new places to settle using FTL they managed to develop in the early 22nd century.
