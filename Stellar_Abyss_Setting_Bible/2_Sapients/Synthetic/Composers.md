# Composers


## Overview
ï¿¼
Composers are perhaps one of the most existentially disruptive beings to have descended from the prospector entities and their grand journey to creating a culture of entropy worship and accelerated development after the "stagnation" of the Utanguis dominated dominion era.

They are responsible for the metasyndicate and they operate heavily within and around it atop of their more independent activities around this quadrant and are borderline worshiped for their role in subverting and destabilizing the Custodians in the Extermination Wars.

The Composers are borderline eldritch, using tech from the sprawl including low level probability distortion tech they scrapes from the ruins of the sprawl and micro-Black hole cannons along with reactionless drives as gadgets they have co-opted, this tech has become more widespread among the non-battered factions as the composers intentionally let older tech diffuse as they find better versions of it in their archeological ventures.
