### Overview

The Lacrox at first glance just seems like one of many megalithic structures in our galaxy.  But its incredibly high age of 970 thousand years has caught the attention of many.  It is made from a reddish stone native to the world of Lacra known as Strip Stone which basically is an incredibly hard to mold kind of rock due to its insane combination of straining resistance and difficulty to erode.  Stripe Stone in this context is an alloy made from the salvaged ruins of some earlier civilization still lost completely to time.  This enigmatic Lacra structure is highly protected and one of several all made from this same material which is a computer based material because these structures are evidently a mind upload archive, though efforts to restore the information is impossible due to the sheer cryptic nature of the storage methods.  They are essentially fossilized computers with alien minds lost to time.  Is it still living or dead has yet to be determined as the crystalline approach to computing used makes it very hard to decrypt or even check the energy signatures of and no one has yet to be willing to crack one open fearing they may destroy a whole civilization.
