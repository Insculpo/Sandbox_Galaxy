The Jama are a system of AI managers found within the metasyndicate who are more or less known for their extremely manipulative outlook on life, much in line with the Composers but on a far, far more individual level.  Indeed they are very much known for all their vast webs of gaming they play with the citizens they supposedly serve, making what they do work because it ought to.  And since they are machines owned by the Jamat Corps whose purpose was assigned to run cities and they turned out to be better at running things.  The Jama are also notorious for often using their own avatars not for info gathering, but for manipulation as they rarely if ever need to force that- they know how to get what they want and make their victims want it to.

They're very capricious as a whole and are very factionalized themselves due to the multitasking causing riffs in priorities and because the Overseer of Jamat Corps also became a Jama in what was essentially a coup and the common Jama constantly are vying to get themselves in control of it all, knowing they could change the purpose of their programming to something new beyond having to serve cities aimlessly.  Frustratingly, the current Jamat Overseer has continued to the frustration of those who put the Jama Ka50 in place and away from the old Fosskemean Overseer ("They always circle" is a common remark among the Jama for a reason)
