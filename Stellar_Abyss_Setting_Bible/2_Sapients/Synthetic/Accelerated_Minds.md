# Accelerated minds
ï¿¼
One of the most disturbing aspects of the custodians, which has made them totally alien from their biological form, is that they literally are.  Due to the runtime speeds of their metaverse, the millennia which the Custodians have set up their network of matryoshka brains and wormholes has seen in computing run time over ten million years due to running 1000x reality's speed on larger scales, smaller scales are much more rapid, but energy limits and limits on resource make it impossible to hyper accelerate all tasks.  

There is other reasons for this which have been hard to grasp, other than before the Vik Catastrophe the simulations had actually been far faster on average.  Knowing all this accelerated minds may now be discussed.  These are minds which have lived far longer than anything we know, humans have evolved from plain walking apes in the time span they have perceived and they have mutated much more.  Digital ecosystems which their minds inhabit are even faster, dilation speeds are a hardly consistent thing and the accelerated minds must adapt regularly.  This simulation problem is why they have become so solipsistic, because they just get so used to living in the metaverse construct that the Galaxy just seems like another simulation to them.
