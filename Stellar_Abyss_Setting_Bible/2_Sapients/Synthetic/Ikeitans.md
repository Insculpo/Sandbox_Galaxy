# The Ikeitans



## Capabilities

They are basically plated in all matter of meta-allows that allow them to shape their living metals in all matter of uninaginable ways by our understanding of chemistry

Imagine if you will electromagnetic fluidic metal that just is mixed with the gelatin-like properties that acts as a means of auto-repairing and creating a refraction barrier that allows them to deflect and redirect most projectiles if they are not direct hits on them

They attack with numerous streams of ferrofluid ejects and sub-fleet ships that swarm their enemies as they often would by human classification be somewhere between a cruiser and a carrier in their niche.  They're hard to classify as they are growing, reproducing entities who give birth to pods.  They don't seem to have a differential of male/female however, instead being whatever they need to be.

The pods sprout and augment over the span of centuries to get to their most advanced states, these pods by just a couple decades can already be a match for conventional ships,  but as they develop they will be simply smarter than most pilots and AI (with sub-AI systems often integrated as part of their greater psychological gestalt in more matured ages to deal with sub-tasks simultaneously and micro-managing whole fleets of sub-ships as they view conventional ships.  They're often coordinating and filled to the brim with defenses.  In the Urzine Domain they supplement their fleets with numerous ships from their uplifted thralls to compensate for the qualitative and long build time it takes to get to true maturation.  

They think on long scales of time, being biologically immortal and the older ones have seen "civilizations rise and fall"- this is more the case with Tatinians than the Urzine of whom are much more delusional and dead set on their war against god with centuries of contempt built up over the dominion's crusades against their communities and the custodian invasion.  And later the Gestalt who they are a primary rival against in the long game to decide the fate of the galaxy as they view it.  They have an on-off relationship with the Composers and Mediators as they worked with them and the silverites in the past against the custodians when it mattered yet the collapse of that solidarity as the devastating, apocalyptic results of the invasions made it clear there was no hope left..

The metasyndicate's rise complicated everything, with ikeitan defectors who had composerized themselves and the general question of who will change the trajectory of reality in a post-dominion world still being unsolved five centuries later
