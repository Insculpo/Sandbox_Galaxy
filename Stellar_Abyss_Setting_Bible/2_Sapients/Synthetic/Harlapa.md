## Harlapa
ï¿¼
The Harlapa are a robotic sapient part of a mechanized ecology on the world of [Lacra](../.../1_Worlds_Systems/Lacra.md).  Whose organic forms died off while their automata continued to exist, who ended up evolving due to intentional design for mutating machinery leading to mutations in the designs.  This led to a mutating machine colony which led to the Harlapa.  The Harlapa view themselves as descendants of sorts, talking of the oppression their ancient ancestors faced from the extinct civilization who made them and the Harlapa haven't achieved space travel yet primarily due to time and their own bouts of self-destruction having kept them from being able to achieve space travel.  

The Harlapa still are strange in their ways due to a modular systems exchange of parts that makes up a large part of their economy which has no biological equivalent and a repeated mantra in outdoing their predecessors even as they prove to be just as self destructive.  And they are very well in showing how humans and other space farmers are very much lucky in their lack of progress destroying incidents nipping them in the bud as it had the Harlapa.
