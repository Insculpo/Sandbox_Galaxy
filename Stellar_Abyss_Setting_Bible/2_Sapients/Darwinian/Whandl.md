### Overview

The Whandl are stick-aliens who reproduce.  They are fuzzy things with many stick-like appendages which bend 4 times radially around their core body.  The Whandl are able to make grabbing limbs with these appendages which are quite versatile.  The Whandi are sulfur breathers like the Vopson and Zakkai.  The Whandi are one of the major species the Utanguis have assimilated during the times of the Dominion.  The Whandl despite their ‘sulfur impairment’ have managed to be an extremely useful alien species and a species that could get shit done.  During the times of the Dominion, the Whandl were one of the early ones to defy the unipolar order of the Dominion- notably with the Platinum Unit who sought a new identity as purveyors of the warmth in the universe with a sense of empathy uncommon in this galaxy.
