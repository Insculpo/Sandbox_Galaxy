### Overview

The Utanguis are three separate species combined into a single sapient being. If these species were separated they would never have made a massive interstellar civilization.  The heads are the Cyrs, the bodies are the Awa and the limbs are the Loka.  Multiple combinations of head and limb exist, but universally a Utanguis will have only a single body to separate itself from another ‘individual’.  They are a very widespread and powerful species in the current day, even in spite of incidents such as the Bilethought or the ikeitan exodus in their deeper history spanning back over the millennia.  The Utanguis have since deviated into many strange forms within their civilization built on advanced synthetic technology that has ran out of their own control or understanding.  The Utanguis are individualistic minded, but not in the same way as us.  All the three species part of a Utanguis are viewed as the same individual and aggressively so; denying that they are the same is viewed as an insult. The Utanguis identify shifts as parts of itself are born and die, attaching and detaching.  The death of the Awa (body), the least sapient part of a Utanguis, ironically is usually viewed as the “death” of an individual even if the head and limbs survive as the body lives much longer than the head or limbs.  A Utanguis can have a single limb, five limbs, two heads and so forth.  The limit is usually two heads and five limbs, anymore and “mental disorders” happen like insanity, plain and simple insanity.  Not to mention it risks encumbering the Awa.  

The Utanguis as a kind are three species in total, each of which unique.

### Biology
 
The Cyrs are symbionts who direct and control the Awas to better pastures in nature, but as they developed their sapience in response to integrating the Loka into their survival strategy along with the tool manipulation of the Loka leading to the creation of shelters, fire and new ways to defend the Awas from would be predators while simultaneously increasing food yields for the Awas.  The Cyrs is smart, often directing the other two species and systemically putting much of its thought process to more systemic planning and partial communication- however the more sociable Loka tend to like talking more.  The Cyrs communicate in a series of weird, jittery hums while the Loka communicate in a more guttural fashion.  The Cyrs is quite big as far as parasites go, relying on a younger, more larval form to latch onto their host before becoming part of the Awas itself.  The Awas also have a larval stage.  The Cyrs are not as social as humans are on the whole, but have generally aligned to the pack structures that the Awas follow due to just how interconnected the two had become over hundreds of millennia of evolution.

The Awas is a large, tetrapodal herbivore who have questionable freedom with the control the Cyrs exert on them, but benefit from the arrangement from a survival perspective.  Awas are more or less herd animals, with a collective mode of social organization.  The Awas live long and have a reputation for storing things.  Be it information, physical cargo or nutrition in their large humps.  The Awas can handle a several hundred kilograms of weight before being too encumbered.  The Awas basically are a pack animal who gained a state of semi-sapience from their symbiotic relation with the Cyrs and don’t seem bothered by this relationship even in modern times.  After all, the Cyrs and Loka "pay their rent" in a figurative sense.  However neither of these species were enough for making advanced tools.  They lacked the precision for tool use and so for many millennia existed in a state humans would see as paleolithic shepherders at best.

That changed with the Loka.  The Loka became the arms and hands of the Utanguis with an intelligence between the Awas and Cyrs.  It is with their ingenuity and dexterity that the Utanguis could fully come into being.  Before their symbiosis, the Loka were in nature were stalkers and ambushers.  The Loka made use of their mandibles in an extremely diverse set of ways, from digging traps to making tools and ambush snatching food to eat.  The Loka are social creatures and can tangle toegther into large numbers, with whole regions simply infested in Loka.  Indeed the Loka for a while were regarded more as a blight than something greater until the past fifty thousand years. However, the lack of long-term mobility meant that the Loka in earlier history would be outcompeted by the gestalt forms of the Utanguis whose loka broke from the tangles and to Awas huddling.  Non-combined Loka simply lack the platform the Awas afforded.  At some point nearly a hundred thousand years ago there was Loka who found the Awas as a useful way to get around.  The Cyrs were tolerated since the Loka liked wrapping around the hump while the Cyrs just stood there on top.  

The Cyrs also was able to find ways to coordinate with the cohabitants to the point of advanced tool usage.  The Loka would develop to also follow the Cyrs, as the Cyrs and Loka needed each other to make fire, advanced tools and more.  The Loka could in theory exist independently, but without the mobility of the Awas the networks of communication that led to increasingly more complex inventions, tools and ideas would not have come to being.  And so those unified Utanguis would twenty thousand years prior become the dominant sapient entity on their homeworld of Blolados.  And for millennia many different packs of Utanguis in the frigid steppes of Blolados slowly advanced to civilizations that had the potential to in some other universe be break with a planetbound existence and become space faring independently.  But in our own universe at a time we would call 100 BC, some AI probes would find their kind and the history of what is known as Prospect Space would begin.
