### Overview

The Utanguis are three separate species combined into a single sapient being. If these species were separated they would never have made a massive interstellar civilization.  The heads are the Cyrs, the bodies are the Awa and the limbs are the Loka.  Multiple combinations of head and limb exist, but universally a Utanguis will have only a single body to separate itself from another ‘individual’.  They are a very widespread and powerful species in the current day, even in spite of incidents such as the Bilethought or the ikeitan exodus in their deeper history spanning back over four millennia.  They have since deviated into many strange forms and have a civilization built on both advanced synthetic technology and magnetic manipulation.  The Utanguis are individualistic minded, but not in the same way as us.  All the three species part of a Utanguis are viewed as the same individual and aggressively so; denying that they are the same is viewed as an insult. The Utanguis identify shifts as parts of itself are born and die, attaching and detaching.  The death of the Awa (body), the least sapient part of a Utanguis, ironically is usually viewed as the “death” of an individual even if the head and limbs survive as the body lives much longer than the head or limbs.  A Utanguis can have a single limb, five limbs, two heads and so forth.  The limit is usually two heads and five limbs, anymore and “mental disorders” happen like insanity, plain and simple insanity.  Not to mention it risks encumbering the Awa.  

The Utanguis as a kind are three species in total, each of which unique.

### Biology
 
The Cyrs are symbionts who direct and control the Awas to better pastures in nature, but as they developed their sapience in response to integrating the Loka into their survival strategy along with the tool manipulation of the Loka leading to the creation of shelters, fire and new ways to defend the Awas from would be predators while simultaneously increasing food yields for the Awas.  The Cyrs is smart, often directing the other two species and systemically putting much of its thought process to more systemic planning and partial communication- however the more sociable Loka tend to like talking more.  The Cyrs communicate in a series of weird, jittery hums while the Loka communicate in a more guttural fashion.  The Cyrs is quite big as far as parasites go, relying on a younger, more larval form to latch onto their host before becoming part of the Awas itself.  The Cyrs can adapt this system to machinery as well, for this reason alone neural robotic technologies are very frequently used by the Utanguis.  The Cyrs are loosely associated beings usually.  They're not as social as humans are.  However, they do have mating selection systems comparable to birds.  For that reason the males tend to have more elaborate chilla and vibrant coloration.  The Cyrs are intelligent and sociable despite this, but only started forming large social groups after a million years of post-convergence evolution. 

The Awas is a large, tetrapodal herbivore which exist in a phyla separate from the Cyrs or Loka, but benefit from their parasitic overlords greatly.  The Cyrs tend to possess a alpha male Awas, who then leads the other female Awas.  Female Awas can be controlled by a Cyrs as well, but said control can be overridden by the Cyrs riding the males due to having to fight the instinctual urges of a female Awas to follow the alpha of the herd.  Awas are more or less herd animals, with a collective mode of social organization.  The Awas live long and have a reputation for storing things.  Be it information, physical cargo or nutrition in their large humps.  The Awas can handle a several hundred kilograms of weight before being too encumbered.  The Awas basically are a pack animal who gained a state of semi-sapience from their symbiotic relation with the Cyrs and don’t seem bothered by this relationship even in modern times.  After all, the Cyrs and Loka "pay their rent" in a figurative sense. 

The Loka are the limbs and hands of the Utanguis and are of an intelligence between the Awas and Cyrs, but their ingenuity and dexterity (for their whole lifestyle is based around their handibles).  They are feisty, opportunistic beings who in nature were stalkers and ambushers.  They make use of their mandible in an extremely diverse set of ways, from digging traps to making tools and ambush snatching food to eat.  They're social creatures and can generate large numbers, with whole regions simply infested in Loka.  However, the lack of long-term mobility meant that the Loka in earlier history would be outcompeted by the gestalt forms of the Utanguis.  Non-combined Loka simply lack the platform the Awas give.  At some point nearly a million years ago there was Loka who found the Awas as a useful way to get around and the Cyrs were tolerated since the Loka liked wrapping around the hump while the Cyrs just stood there on top.  The Cyrs also is just too big.  Two Loka co-habit a Awas, a male and female for life and they are very trusting of other Loka as the Loka have language as well.  The Loka languages complicate the Utanguis writing system so much than a mutual script is what would become dominate in the Epoch of Unifiers.  The Loka have developed a much more intense relationship with the Cyrs, as the Cyrs and Loka need each other to make fire, tools and eventually more sophisticated technologies/architecture.  The Loka are segmented and can stiffen/loosen their many joints as needed.  The Loka can exist independently, but without the mobility of the Awas the networks of communication that led to increasingly more complex inventions, tools and ideas would likely not have come to being. 

The Utanguis are a very freakish anomaly in the existence of life, to say the least.  The Utanguis view this ‘anomaly’ as proof of some greater cause of their existence, but what this cause is has never really been divined beyond a sense of exceptionalism the Utanguis have had only reinforced in their dominance of our part of the galaxy (so is it really our part of the galaxy?) 

The Utanguis are the dominant force in the galaxy today, not affiliated with the Sprawl but still relevant for being the civilization to continue in spirit what the Sprawl set out to achieve and indeed, the Sprawl may have found new life in these upstarts who have come to dominate the place.  Even in spite of their lack of ability to do whatever it takes for a truly eternal society.

**The seven "classes" of The Utanguis**

Cyrawas
Awaloka
Utanguis
Cyrs
Awas
Loka

**Cobaltine Classes (second level)**

*Cyrloka*

 Only possible with a machine/synth replacement of the Awas.  Very diverse class of Utanguis that act much like cyborgs and are quite horrifying due to being so "unnatural" to the Majority in the Gestalt (but in various other societies they are increasingly embraced and even a sizable portion of the populace).

*The divided*

Cyrs and Loka that have decided to go against millennia of history believing the whole composite thing to be obsolete and pointless weight.  However, they also ended up severing the intimate relations they once had to each other, causing serious tensions in regards to how a independent Cyrs species or a independent Loka species will cooperate or if they will cooperate instead of creating more divides in a already culturally and linguistically divided mess that is the modern Utanguis.  There is so mani philosophical wars fought over this one issue it is insane simply due to the implications- how can the Utanguis bring harmony to hundreds of species if harmony can't be achieved with the mere three the Utanguis composes itself as?

### Building to Utopia

These three beings unified into large cities, grand caravans and hordes over time.  Their long history is filled with hundreds of civilizations, as written record appeared for them nearly forty-six thousand years ago with large gaps.  For unlike us they did had pre-historic civilizations as long periods of entropy or civilizations that didn’t sense any need for writing came and went.  In their millennia of existing, it is only in the fifth epoch (the Cobalt Epoch), which still is ongoing- that technological civilization began to flourish for them.  The Utanguis aren’t stupid, it should be noted, the span of evolution to civilization is actually shorter for them than it is for us.  It’s simply that they had written records for much longer.  It is hard for humans to understand since they had only 5000 years of /written/ history, unlike the Cyrawlaoc who can reference records of their ancient past from over ten thousand years ago!  A human archeologist could only dream of that.  Gobleki Tepe, Jericho, Catal Hyuk and such settlements existed in the deep past for humans, and just imagine these cultures having written language from the start.  

The Utanguis evidently had known about their solar system’s arrangement for thousands of years, and the knowledge of their binary system (including some worlds from the other star) comes from the highest societies of the deep ancients using telescopes.  They weren’t industrial, however.  Such benefits would only be brought by the Prospectors.
