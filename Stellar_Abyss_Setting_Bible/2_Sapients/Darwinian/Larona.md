# The Laronians

The Laronians emerged within the vast void ecologies of Wildspace as one of various emergent sapients who exist as part of and within the greater mind of the Vast One that is a literal, real diety for them.

The Laronians despite their artificial selection and pressures from the advanced biology within Wildspace are extremely metallic and removed from their organic, jungled origins.  Instead taking on a range of plasma manipulation technologies and radiation oriented technology.  This tech has made them extremely odious for the Grand Ones to the point the Vast One tries to Sabotage them through fleets of eusocial creatures who act as the immune system of the Vast One.  Indeed the Laronians are believed to have been a rogue component of these, though much more aggressive due to constantly in perpetual conflict with the Vast One and ending up in expansion wars with the Architect civilizations that make them high stress societies despite all their advancements.  Highly disciplined suicide castes of fighters are the norm as the Laronian desire for beauty is framed in violence since violence is all they collectively can know as far as they can tell.  Their creators hate them, those around them hate them, everything hates them- even other Laronians hate other Laronians.  So they act as a collective conflagration, devouring and annihilating each other in a cascading reaction.  Outsider groups like Archivists and Folding Ones find them disturbing reminiscent of the Simmiforms, however different they may be in origin and development.  

Laronians are not singular in form, but do have archetype forms that permeate as a result of that pressure from their ecological convergences as former Vast One dependent organisms

This is a crude rendition of one, first go.  In general you see multiple cooperative archetypes who act as a sort of feedback mechanism to fuel their endless fire across the region of the galaxy they have come to call their own.  

They don't seem to have a concept of end goal and self awareness is warped, their motives are mostly built around ravenous wants but lacking the organization or organization of huge minds beyond the degree to which the selection pressures of the Vast One and architects have forced them to adapt.

Specialized laronians who exist mainly as vacuum beings part of suicide castes and engineers.  In their own logic, it isn't even a hierarchy like thing.  They do as they do because that is what they do.  They are very mechanistic in that regard, since there is that constant, compulsive want to conform to the aesthetic demands of performative violence that leads to lots of ritualizing infighting that has more instinct than institution to it.  For such conflicts are known for having more in common with mating fights.  

Though mating and fighting are a blend, for a species whose gametes are derived from the Vast One's aggregation gametes where biological sex as we know it isn't a thing.  Instead fertilized eggs come about from lots of them spilling their gamete infused blood on each other and their spawn parasitically live in the corpses or survivors of the ritual wars to spring forth and continue the performative violence.

How such entities developed advanced technology is a question of meta stable states caused by the needs to develop new ways of defending against the Vast One early on where you had hyper minds as the prominent entitie before they suffered such terminal brain damage that they collapsed into the raging fire which they are now known for.  As well various species of Vast One lesser sapients had been caught up in their flame with their tech absorbed by the laronians when they weren't forced to be part of the ritual wars without any tribute desires beyond conscripts.  

The vastness of the modern laronia comes from millennia of build up and they do progress into different ages/eras, indeed they do actually have contact and diplomacy.  It's just that it's all forced into the framing of the pressure and never ending desire to release.  They have no consistent sense of control or consistent matters for others, only interested in sending their members to other wars in exchange for tech, a completely one sided deal for them as their relationship to death and life is so broken and contorted by their extremely violence oriented mating cycles.  

The apparently different forms of laronia are illusion, they can be thought of at most as sub species of some vast universal species they all breed from.  This is why they're Laronia and not part of the Vast One.

And more importantly, it's not remotely clear if this form of Laronia is a product or truly nature.  As earlier eras had more stable incarnations before the Vast One tried to exterminate them and inciting their violence as a result.   Laronian existence has been always precarious thanks to knowing everything in existence hates them, even the very environments they developed within.  They are scary advanced for a civ of this nature, plasma flow manipulation is everywhere as is the integration of Vays into some of their militaries along with vacuum exciting bombs they use all the time.  And it's often used against themselves, just for the sake of it as they warp plasma currents into very elaborate patterns of deaths.
