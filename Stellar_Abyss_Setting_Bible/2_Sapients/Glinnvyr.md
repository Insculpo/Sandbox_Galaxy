### Overview

Glinnvyr are beings from a frigid, tundra-like world where oily pools are frequent.  Despite the metabolism poor environment, the Glinnvyr have transcended the slowness of typical low metabolism existence by shifting metabolic states.  Shifting between being statue-like one minute and moving at insane rates as needed.  The Glinnvyr are in a niche akin to a more social jaguar, climbing in trees and hunting down prey.  However, despite their low sociality they can be shockingly coordinated.  Their social structure is more egalitarian and individualistic than humans, with much less social stratification in general, often being united by common ideas more than by kinship.  The Glinnvyr body design is very elongated, with jointed limbs that at the third joint split into two sub-limbs which act like both extremely large grabbers with their hands and feet at the ends of them.  

The Glinnvyr in nature had the niche of some ambush predator in arboreal climates.  They are rather individualistic in how they conduct relationships, often tending towards smaller social hierarchies and groups except in certain circumstances.  The Glinnvyr hunted as obligate carnivores and having to do so with much less energy than what Earth had- though their environment wasn't entirely arboreal as the oxygen fumes from organic cyrovolcano dwelling mega flora and a relatively warmer environment from say, Titan meant that there is a 1.4% oxygen content on their world.  

Cyrovulcanism and Oil is what the life of their world thrives from this may come off as shocking given the widespread idea of water being like lava to the Glinnvyr which is only partially true- it's more like scalding bleach than lava.  Molten Sulfur on the other hand is pretty much lava to them.  Still, water is quite toxic for the Glinnvyr with too much exposure and the Glinnvyr use water mainly for industrial purposes instead.  They also used water in their rocket fuel with hydrogen rockets in earlier time periods (for early Glinnvyr space travel centered on cyrovolcano pressure launching).

The biology of the Glinnvyr is notable for having extremely elongated limbs due to the low gravity of their world and the need to make rapid movements with less energy- scuttling simply is too costly in a low oxygen environment.  Hydrocarbons are the lifeline of any Glinnvyr and you often will find the Glinnvyr with lots of oil drinks everywhere they go in temperate climates like that of Earth.   The Glinnvyr also make use of rubbery amplification suits designed to withstand the strong gravity wells of higher gravity worlds which can be quite limb breaking for their rather fragile kind (they have to crawl everywhere in earth-like gravity without the strength modifiers, 1.7 G starts causing the limb breaking).  

### Psychology

The Glinnvyr are extremely mode based, or mood based, there is a vibe based way of flow to their whole existence they sense and the context they perceive the universe is extremely non-human; they really do seem to sense reality as a set of manifested forms that are distorted from their perfection and have a science that is as much superstition as it is science, but has a logic that is deductive and experimental enough that real discoveries have been made.  The Chronoturgists being the most notable example, figuring out how to distort the flow of time regionally to accelerate or slow down the relative time rate down to the scale of enters.

The Glinnvyr can radically alter their time perception as needed, in factors of 100 at most.  Most Glinnvyr tend to seem like statues until they inexplicably move rapidly, sometimes in sync, sometimes in a sequence of freezing and unfreezing.  While not socially stratified, there are cultures of Glinnvyr that are exceptionally coordinated in regards to their time dilating as their reaction times are far, far faster than ours.  The Glinnvyr developed their own form of FTL independently that involves opening gateways to other star systems over time as opposed to warping directly to a place.  (Or a krasnikov tube) The Glinnvyr usually live in smaller groups, with even their major factions being not being terribly huge in population.  The Glinnvyr are ancient enough to have existed during the collapse of the Sprawl, and were nearly invaded by the Sprawl.  The Glinnvyr have spread out significantly since then.

The Glinnvyr have many forms but all follow the same baseline body plan, though some are much fatter and more integrated into the cream than others.

### Culture

The Glinnvyr make use of mind-melding AI systems in the Wisest alongside genetic modification done to make new or exaggerated morphs they can consciously adapt much faster than nature intended, to the point where they have shapeshifter clades. Altering their action/thought pattern is always done to allow for faster cycling or better synced movement instead of ridding of it as it is just too innate to them and they just don't see any advantages in thinking/doing something at the same time. Even their automations follow these principles except for hair trigger defense systems.

The Glinnvyr are highly ritualistic and have many belief systems, these take many forms of varying dogmatism. Their civilization is cults built on cults, occultism is a reoccurring motif for their kind and they are extremely cryptic with other species due to their tendency towards laconic speech and using clearly stated movement in speeches, scientific inquiries or celebrations with noises being quick commands or shouts for help usually. They are very experimentation based; all their cults are just viewed as moral experiments in the long term of things with some making full blown theocracies. It is very hard to grasp how such superstitious aliens can also be so in tune with scientific methods, or at least happen to use them in a way that gives them the technological advancements to be a space faring civilization.

The Glinnvyr do not actually have an ethnic cult, they're individualistic and despite the xenophobia are prone to sometimes prioritize the wellbeing of an idea over the wellbeing of their species of the individual is compelled by it enough.  In general, Individual Glinnvyr can actually be rather friendly, but when in large aggregations they turn more xenophobic to outside ideas.  Assimilating other species to their mode of thought is what they do instead of genocide usually.
