# The Civics

The Civics are the collective name given to the peculiar emergence of two interstellar civilizations near each other.  Mainly, the Humans and Tikali.  They have advanced more rapidly than usual as a result of having two civs with different perspectives yet different niches cooperating on R&D that didn't dominate out one or the other like with other places.
