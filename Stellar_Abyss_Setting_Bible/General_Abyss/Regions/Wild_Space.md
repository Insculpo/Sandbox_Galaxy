# Wild Space

 Wild Space is the collective name given to a vast network of void ecologies.  Multiple civilizations had arisen in the great mold, of varied natures and ways as the great mold's ecological setup varies from place to place.

In general one finds easily the largest network of space faring entities in the galaxy as organisms here drift from Star to Star, festering and colonizing.  The world seeds, the terraformers.  The life of the great mold all is related to a common ancestry of distant origins.  While other lesser void ecologies exist outside Wild Space, within Wild Space one finds the most elaborate expression of it.  Massive asteroid belt ecologies, worlds filled with the multitudes of networked flora that communicate with networks of colonizer asteroids and spore worlds that fill whole star systems that spread out to many other star systems.  

On larger scale these spores manifest into the great Minds, who slowly be with intent direct the mold.  These vast beings agree only on the spread of the mold, but differ on what the mold should be.  This has manifested in a wide range of conflicts that percolated more complex entities and species including smaller scale intelligences.  Such smaller scale intelligences include the Laronians, who went rogue on the mold, the Pink Spacers who "parasitized" on the mold (everything does in their own way, to be fair) or the Sleepers, who after spreading and interfacing with the mold went en masse into hibernation, their complicated and ancient wormhole network grown over in the intervening millennia and somewhat intergating themselves as one of the megascale sapients that the mold of built from.  

These megascale sapients include the Tarpi, who are notably diseased, the Stolopid, who intentionally devolve and in general have very nebular appearances.

The great mold is huge, it expands across a large share of the galaxy away from the Architect and even getting near the Ancient Ecumene who historically had pushed the earlier mold back and even had wars with the ancient ecumene, ones which continue with mold overgrown sprawl clusters completely cut off from the rest of the galaxy.
