(Region)


The ancient Ecumene was the first emergent civilization, though the emergence narrative is often in dispute as Wild Space and the Galactic Core both hosted considerably more ancient space faring Civilizations.  What is known of these ancients is that they came from beings known as the Calzonit, and is also where the Dioviermes and some of the various sprawl endemic species originated from.  In ancient times these was a wormhole network civ known as the Pantheon, it collapsed.  There was also beings simply known as Builders, who persist in the region to this day.  Than a range of civs percolated about it, until the Dioviermes arose.  They made a wide range of factions, with the Sprawl arising from them and attempting to colonize the whole galaxy.  They got into conflict with the Virgo, the Great Mold and the other Ecumenical species, eventually hitting a point of apocalyptic collapse that caused the sprawl to cut itself off from the Ancient Ecumene and many sprawl clusters were abandoned. Indeed, that "outer Sprawl" in modern times is so removed from the Ancient Ecuemene that it is viewed as a whole different region despite once being very connected with the Ancient Ecumenist societies.  As a result both regions share a lot of species.
