# Galactic Core

The core of the galaxy and its associated societies.  Various entities adapted to the galactic core have emerged, with the Virgo completely dominating it with extreme protection.  They don't care much for the rest of the galaxy, but have been perturbed by both the Sprawl and the Sleepers before.
