# Broken Space

Broken Space is a region of space where the bulk of space travel has been monopolized by groups of entities collectively known as the Zikelli.  The Zikelli are where interstellar nomads are everywhere as the Zikelli monopolized most space travel in the region.  The Zikellite client species are more dinovidualistic and tend to forget the Zikelli exist, as they're a slow acting species that use minimal energy to sustain elaborate things.  Some say there was a failed upstart civ in the region, others are less sure due to the high amounts of space-time blisters and range of anomalies that fester in the region.
