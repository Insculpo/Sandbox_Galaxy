# The Sprawl

The sprawling network of city worlds that connects a lot of the galaxy through an ancient wormhole network.  Much of this article deals primarily with the large sprawl network connecting multiple upstart civilizations.  Other parts of the sprawl are either destroyed or too disconnected to be relevant.  The Sprawl attempted to spread the Ancient Ecumene across the galaxy but collapsed, becoming the fragmented and disconnected mess that it remains to this day.

## Worlds

This is a list of notable worlds.  Most if not all have local life, but this is less because life is hyper-common and more because of all the volumes of space occupied by the civilizations of the Civic reaching many worlds.

Due to how many worlds there are, there's a tagging system to follow.

[Anomalous] - World with highly anomalous properties.
[Sapient Locals] - Has sapient locals
[Heavily Colonized] - Is a highly colonized world
[Constructed] - Is an artificial world
[Aborted] - Is a destroyed/ruined world

## Sapients

The Sprawl is connected to the Ancient Ecumene, various sprawl species originated from the Ancient Ecumene.  So what is shown here are Sprawl entities in general, instead of strictly beings of the sprawl.  So you see a lot of overlap with the species.
