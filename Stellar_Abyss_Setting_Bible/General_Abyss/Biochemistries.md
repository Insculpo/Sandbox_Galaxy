## Chart of Molecular Life

This it the chart of molecular life.  There is life outside the scope of those formed from chemical reactions - Nuclear forces can also in some circumstances create forms of life, for instance - but this chart is mostly concerned with chemical reactions.  There is obviously a lot more than this, but this chart is the general one used for the most common forms of life.

## Nuclear Entities



## Kinetic Entities

Kinetic Entities appear in multiple complex systems that do so in ways that cannot be charted to molecular chemistry.  They often do end up causing chemistry based life as a byproduct of their existence, however.  They are collectively known as "Kinetic Entities" because they are alternative emergences from complex molecular systems that can at times create non-equivalent cosmic patterns.  Indeed it is hard to say if these truly do count as life or not due to the absence of any molecular programming.  They do evolve and even have some forms of inheritance from information seeding prior generations cause, but it is hard to say if this evolution is truly "life" or just a form of evolution more akin to stellar evolution and geological cycles.

Such emergent entities can be grouped into a few super classifications.

* **Cloud/fluid Minds** - Fluid Minds are the byproduct of complex oceanic-atmospheric interactions that create reactive vortex cells that act as a functional equivalent to organic cells.  They tend to be so large that a fluid mind needs often a whole superterran world to have one such mind exist.  And such minds are notable for in some ways acting as very efficient heat dissipation, more so than cloud systems that didn't cascade into complex cellular networks.  Such complexities come also from how lightning interconnects the wind cells like signal transmissions.

* **Auroric Ecologies** - Aurora systems in complex interactions of magnetospheres not only create rather unique light shows, but also can cause complex chain reactions of radiative feedback that lead to life-like products.  Such auroric ecologies have other exotic properties like not actually being cells.  Instead they are a constant flux state that is unable to achieve any equilibrium, instead diffusing into increasing degrees of entropy that is counter acted by other forces in their arrangement.  

* **Convectives** - Convectives are easily the most common form of such kinetics, even Earth has them.  Convectives appear wherever tectonic activity allows for it.  They usually exist in the regions of convective friction, or where cells intersect/push against each other.  Such convectives basically are able to momentarily think and see, slightly altering the system in the process.  Such convectives exist as byproducts basically, byproducts of the heat loss over many eons.  Older worlds have more advanced form of convectives that make use of the colder environment to remember things through large geode-like crystalline deposits that encode surface information.  Convectives can appear on cloudy worlds as well, but often need more complex wind interaction to the point they become part of an organized cloud mind.  

These systems often interlock to higher degrees of complexity should such high emergences co-exist in the same place.  And further such complexities emerge still should molecular life also be present, leading to situations where planets manage to alter their own orbital and gravitational trajectories at will and even anticipate supernovae from the sun.
