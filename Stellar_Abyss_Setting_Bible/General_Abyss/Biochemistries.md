## Chart of Molecular Life

This it the chart of molecular life.  There is life outside the scope of those formed from chemical reactions - Nuclear forces can also in some circumstances create forms of life, for instance - but this chart is mostly concerned with chemical reactions.  There is obviously a lot more than this, but this chart is the general one used for the most common forms of life.

**Definitions**
Solvent - The fluid/gas used for dissolve lots of
Polymer Type - The base atom type used to make the polymers used by this Life
Metabolic Control - Kind of metabolic control used by these organisms
Temperature Range - Range of temperature they occur at (solvent pegged)
Pressure Range - Range of pressure they occur at (pressure pegged)
Rate of Recurrence -The rate this kind of life occurs in our Galaxy
Additional Info - Anything else
