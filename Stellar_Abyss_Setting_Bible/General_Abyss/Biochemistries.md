## Chart of Molecular Life

This it the chart of molecular life.  There is life outside the scope of those formed from chemical reactions - Nuclear forces can also in some circumstances create forms of life, for instance - but this chart is mostly concerned with chemical reactions.  There is obviously a lot more than this, but this chart is the general one used for the most common forms of life.
