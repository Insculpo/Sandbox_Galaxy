# Appa

## Biography

Appa is one of the Composers that has found its way to the "civics" as they've come to view them.  Appa is mainly in communication with various groups in the Civics mainly trying to help prop them back up to avoid complexity reversions the Golden Swarm had caused.  They want the humans killing each other again ultimately, but the situation Appa found was just sad.  Appa seems to have not much motive outside of this, at least as far as those part of the Imperium can tell.
