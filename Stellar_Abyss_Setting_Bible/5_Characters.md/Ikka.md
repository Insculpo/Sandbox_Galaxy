# Ikka

## Overview

Another Composer that has been found in human and Tikali territories, mainly with Fosskemian raiders and is mainly a privateering force trying to cause more conflict .  Appa hates Ikka as Ikka is "causing dissonance" to the region.  Ikka's associations with the Collectors does not help and Ikka's general vision of a massive trade hub between the civics and prospect spacers it dominates alone has hardly sit well with others seeking the same thing.
