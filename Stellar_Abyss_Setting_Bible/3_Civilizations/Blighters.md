# Blighters

## Overview

Blighters are a branch of Mizar who view the rest as pests and try to spread disease intentionally.  The Blighters are never really opposed by other Mizar as other Mizar tend to only care of themselves.  Blighters have a track record as a feared, terroristic society that cannot be reasoned with.  The Blighters have managed to effectively unmake themselves without breaking conformity with the Mizar by targeting their hatred towards other species instead of targeting other Mizar.  The Blighters have been driven largely by a desire against destruction, but believe they outsiders to be the most destructive to begin.  And so to keep their gardens good, concluded they had to trim the pests of Wild Space with an endless laboratory of super bugs spread throughout the galaxy.  They have managed all this by their ability to act independent of the other Mizar and tend to only make use of a vast library of death whenever they feel particularly threatened.  The Blighters notably have afflicted the Abandoned Sprawl with their artificial bioplagues, which are more akin to an insidious form of grey goo than some darwinian bacterium.  They also infected a lot of the sleeper network.
