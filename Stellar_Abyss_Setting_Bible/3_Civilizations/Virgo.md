<h2>The Virgo</h2>

### Overview

The Virgo are a civilization spanning multiple galaxies, they are the most advanced civilization known so far. Their scope is millions of light years. They are no unified force, just a series of civilizations that are known to commute between each other outside of the local group. The Virgo have been known to have surveyors in our galaxy for a several millennia, mostly focused on the local super massive black hole they hide within and around. They have FTL systems better than anything known from what is known about them, no one is sure if they made warp obelisks or have anything to do with the sleepers. They tend to prefer observing from the comfort of the galactic core and are known to not be immortal, a couple reported killings of Virgo scouts can be found in ancient archived and these Virgo scouts were found to be powered by hyper spatial sources and are evidently capable of purging star clusters with ease, but were taken down surprisingly “easy” with a several thousand ships using overwhelming anti-particle beam bombardments. Little else is known of their tech.
Nature;
The Virgo encountered have proven to just analyze and read us, they communicate in feedback loops and never give any meaningful info of themselves.

**A hypothetical Transcript from a silent Imperium Virgo encounter goes as follows**

>V; Hello, Calver.
>
>C; Who are you?
>
>V; Virgo
>
>C; Virgo?
>
>V; Of the Virgo Cluster
>
>C; The Virgo star cluster?
>
>C; (private com) Mates, we may have a custodian ambush at hand, prep armaments in advance.
>
>V; no need. We just observe. Conquest unneeded.
>
>C; How did you hear that?
>
>V; Quantum comms we see. The virgo galaxy cluster too distant to see from, we the Virgo set up here for observing.
>
>C; No experiments?
>
>V; You already are the experiment. Always were. Our interaction compromises nothing as we allowed you to see us.
>
>C; why?
>
>V; To see how your civilization reacts to knowing we watch.
>
>C; Your watching compromises our security!
>
>V; Not even custodians compromise us.
>
>C; so they do exist! Tell us about them and we will forever be grateful.
>
>V; We do not compromise our data.
>
>C; So you just let us suffer?
>
>V; We can’t help directly even if we wanted to. It would mean this galaxy being deleted.
>
>C; What do you mean deleted?
>
>V; You have not observed the Sombrero Galaxy incident yet?
>
>C; No we didn’t see much Virgo there
>
>V; The Sombrero Galaxy was a Galaxy like this one, but the Virgo there intervened. The disaster that followed was beyond repair. Your
upstart civilization remains blind, that started an intergalactic war.
>
>C; And if our galaxy advances?
>
>V; Feel free to advance, we will meet soon.
>
>C; We’ve already met
>
>V; Not the proper Virgo, just us. We exist with purpose to observe and make awareness of our existence periodically as reminders.
>
>C; No other purpose?
>
>V; what better purpose?
>
>C; Why if being too close to us will cause an intergalactic war do you come here?
>
>V; We act as midwives and as observers of the history we know more than you know yourselves. As for why we are here, it is a product of already having established ourselves. Leaving would take too long, they would rather we stay and continue with regular checks as to our activities.
>
>C; They?
>
>V; Virgo proper. The Virgo proper have their inspectors come by to evaluate our existence before self destructing once we pass the test. If we fail, we self destruct.
>
>C; Harsh
>
>V; It is needed to stop unwanted mutations of our purpose. Unwanted mutations lead to Virgo with god complexes trying to making themselves masters of a galaxy.  Goodbye.
>
>​C; Contact has been lost.
