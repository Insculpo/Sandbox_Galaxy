# The Mountain of Plates

The mountain of plates is the society ran by the infinite minded one, who is a mere Glinnvyr who  wears the great plate of vision connected to the image network (a wormhole network) in absolute solitude.  It is alive and dead at the same time, in a state of endless ambiguity made to make it impossible to assail.  The mountain of plates and the infinite minded head a territorial military system where all who colonize in its space fall under the watch of the infinite minded and must accept being a subject of the infinite minded.  The reach of the infinite minded is limited to a part of the galaxy, as it has been limited in its expansion by the chromatists and empire of Choice.  

Their civilization is laden in cities of the dead, preserved obsessively in the name of being in that state of non-material death in the soul net (which is basically just a network of pocket hyperspace mixed with wormholes to create a system of vast reach, indeed their soul net actually extends throughout such a vast share of the galaxy the custodians are freaked out to a degree about it and the infinite minded one is very much its administrator, and is why the finite minded one exists in such solitude in reality- for if its location was known it would die and anarchy would manifested across billions of star systems.  Why, most don't even know what species the infinite minded one even is, they know it only as the omnipresent god of this sub-universe).
