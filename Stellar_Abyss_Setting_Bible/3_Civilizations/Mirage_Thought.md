# The Mirage Thought

The Mirage Thought is an ivoltic collective who have spent ages building themselves into a multitude of patchworks, all of them incredibly cryptic and built on the creation of imaginary effects from structured systems of existence to make the true ivoltic as they view it.   A hallucinatory effect is what they are looking for- A living mirage able to affect existence itself.  They are perhaps one of the most dedicated efforts to such imagination and this ability to imagine makes them in effect a civilization centered around massive biological computing systems acting under a very spiritual fashion.  W

hile they do not seem to be under custodianesque delusions, they do seem committed to their projecting of a greater vanguard being than themselves.  Something of which they have had some success in, in so far that they generated a network of blissful happiness for all those within and unlike the Ivoltic who actively seek out assimilations, many outsiders actively go the Mirage Growth mainly since the existing in the Mirage Growth is said to be like an endless, never ending orgasm in a state of total freedom from the woes of reality as many beings concierge to collectively imagine the true god of the universe to being.  Or so the claims pushed go.
