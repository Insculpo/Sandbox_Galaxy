<h2>The Mediators</h2>

### Overview

The Mediators are a powerful Cyrawaloc Empire, the Cyrawaloc Empire as it were. They are in open perpetual conflict with their multiple rivals- The Urzine, the Silent Imperium and the Metasyndicate That has been on an ongoing proxy conflict for the greater ecumenical region of living civilization. The Mediators also have influence over Cooperative politics and all matter of swarms along with ongoing efforts to raid and rummage about the depths of the sprawl.
The centrality of the Mediators in our part of the galaxy cannot be underestimated. While other regions of the galaxy are dominated by other civilizations, the Mediators are the most well known of these civilizations.

### Beliefs

The Mediators come from a lineage of multiple other civilizations that had risen and fallen before it derived from the mythical cobalt. Having been founded after bioweapons such as the cancer were unleashed and the ikeitan bioships arose, the Mediators remain a society entrenched in the baggage of millennia old struggles and infrastructure such as the interstellar highways of older times being retrofitted for their needs or the remnants of older megastructures being repaired and recolonized.

The Mediators themselves outlook wise hold to somewhat of a secular outlook built around biological integration and the belief of civilization as a living organism is widespread and enforced by the very tech they use being living. The Mediators don’t have nearly the sort of separation of bodies we tend to think about, where every body is a closed system beyond the bacteria that pass through us. Instead even consciousness itself is a fluid passed around numerous nodes and this leads the Mediators to have a civilization of identities and personalities spread across multiple organisms, sometimes from entirely different worlds. This mainly applies to the dominant culture however, but it remains an outlook that trickles down.

The Mediator consciousness stream relies of multiple bodies much as it is always viewed to have from the Cyrawaloc sapients who are responsible for space travel in our region of the galaxy to begin with. Some of these gestalt consciousnesses are world spanning, if not even interstellar in scope due to the hyperways. Still, the Mediator usage of synthetic technologies and an understanding of biology seemingly unparalleled has led to biotechnology being a massive basis of their civilization to the point where they make use of all matter of synthetic gel systems that construct into whatever constructed forms they need them too when they aren’t making countless bioengineered diseases or entities seemingly having learned nothing from the cancer.

The old traditional beliefs in the Dozinian hierarchy are still widely practiced as are more traditional Cyrawaloc celebrations and initiation rituals, indeed such initiation rituals had been abstracted and utilized to integrate their many uplifts, assimilate alien species and give special rights to Cyrawaloc within the Mediator hierarchy.

### Structure

The Mediators follow a somewhat hierarchal system with various semi-independent branches of power that when combined with the starways allow them to consolidate over an impressive span of space while also having a massive hegemony that is the envy of countless civilizations. The Mediator Hierarchy relies on a higher council that acts as the representational elite of the Mediators, where a council of representatives makes all the important decisions. The system is somewhat of a timocracy, where voting such representatives is viewed as a privilege for those who are most qualified to make such choices... ironically this had failed to stop some particularly poor councils from forming at critical points in time due to the Neopotism rampant in Mediator culture and how qualified can mean simply being a good friend of someone as opposed to someone who knows well about their very situation. The highest power within their system is the Mediator caste leader in practice, with their association holding much of the power despite the existence of the council who basically exist to work out the more civilian matters despite lacking any jurisdiction over the military forces who act entirely independently. The council has its own private military force from the Mediators, but it isn’t able to consolidate due to the lack of staying power council members have.
The Mediators aren’t bioship controlled like the other great biomorphic civilizations, instead they are controlled by higher order Cyrawaloc elites who answer to a greater gestalt consciousnesses who is often a single, pathetic Cyrawaloc who claims communion. The gestalt as a whole is viewed as the supreme consciousness of the mediators, with many of the diplomats encountered being vessels of this greater consciousness for part of the time- it’s seen as a pleasure and privilege to do so.

### Demographics

20% Cyrawaloc
8% Fosskemian
18% Vopson
10% Sarkic
39% Synthetic Entities
4.5% Other sapients
0.5% Megasynthetic Entities

The total population of the Mediator Gestalt is hard to know due to the shifting allegiances of the inhabitants, with a flux of 10% of the population on a regular basis in the ecumenical frontier regions. this lends to a population around 6.5-7 quadrillion separate individual minds who are part of Mediator space. This betrays the true biomass of their civilization, with is far greater than the population suggests.

### Tech

The Mediators make use of a vast range of biotech and growable technologies within a paradigm of biometal based processing that makes up the basing for their civilization’s tech with advancements getting as far as a primitive form of star lifting and dyson swarms developing in multiple parts of their society.
The vast scope of the Mediators is borderline incomprehensible for most human beings to even begin to understand, with memetic kill devices being common along with their mastery of biology allowing them to use precision radiation to alter genetics of others into incomprehensibly alien creatures or just do this with parasites. Organic life to the Mediators is something to be molded at will. There is somewhat of a sterility to Mediator civilization all tech as well that separates it from the Urzine who are similarly advanced but their embrace of Darwinian thinking makes them radically different in their usage of the same tech.
