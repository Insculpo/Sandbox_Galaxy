<h2>The Mediators</h2>

### Overview

The Mediators are a civilization built on duplicity.  The Mediator Gestalt is the product of the Gestalt and Mediators, two former apparati of the Dominion, merging after centuries of division.  Attempts to consolidate the Silver Legion would be far less successful.  

The Mediators are in open perpetual conflict with their multiple rivals- The Urzine, the Silent Imperium and the Metasyndicate That has been on an ongoing proxy conflict for the [vus](Cultural_Beliefs/Vus_Valuation.md) of greater ecumenical region of living civilization. The Mediators as one of the most powerful empires of the quadrant we exist in also have influence over the politics of many societies across the known galaxy.

The centrality of the Mediators in our part of the galaxy cannot be underestimated. While other regions of the galaxy are dominated by other civilizations, the Mediators are the most relevant to the concerns of the Civic and much of Prospect Space.  Their clout is everywhere.

### Beliefs

The Mediators come from a lineage of multiple other civilizations that had risen and fallen before it derived from the mythical cobalt. Having been founded after bioweapons such as the cancer were unleashed and the ikeitan bioships arose, the Mediators remain a society burdened with the baggage of millennia old struggles and infrastructure.  Such as the interstellar highways of older times being retrofitted for their needs or the remnants of older megastructures being repaired and recolonized.

The Mediators themselves outlook wise hold to somewhat of a secular outlook built around biological integration.  The belief of civilization as a living organism is widespread and enforced by the very tech they use being mutagenic, living and of a style steeped in their mastery of biological processes. The Mediators don’t have nearly the sort of separation of bodies we tend to think about, where every body is a closed system beyond the bacteria that pass through us.

Instead even consciousness itself is a fluid passed around numerous nodes.  This leads the Mediators to have a civilization of identities and personalities spread across multiple organisms, sometimes from entirely different worlds. This mainly applies to the highest classes of Mediator society, but it remains an outlook that trickles down.

The Mediator consciousness stream relies of multiple bodies much as it is always viewed to have from the Utanguis.  Some of these gestalt consciousnesses are world spanning, if not even interstellar in scope due to the hyperways. Still, the Mediator usage of synthetic technologies and an understanding of biology seemingly unparalleled has led to biotechnology being a massive basis of their civilization.  This is to the point where they make use of all matter of synthetic gel systems which construct into whatever constructed forms they need them to.  That is, when they aren’t making countless bioengineered diseases or entities seemingly having learned nothing from the cancer.

The old traditional beliefs in the Dozinian hierarchy are still widely practiced as are more traditional Cyrawaloc celebrations and symbiosis rituals.   Indeed such symbiosis rituals had been abstracted and utilized to integrate their many uplifts, assimilate alien species and perpetuate the idea of species meritorcracy.  Where the ladder of Dozin can be climbed.

### Structure

The Mediators follow a hierarchal system with various semi-independent branches of power that when combined with the starways allow them to consolidate over an impressive span of space.  All the while also having a massive hegemony to the envy of countless civilizations. The Mediator Hierarchy relies on a higher council that acts as the representational elite of the Mediators, where a council of representatives makes all the important decisions. The system is somewhat of a timocracy, where voting such representatives is viewed as a privilege for those who are most qualified to make such choices... ironically this had failed to stop some particularly poor councils from forming at critical points in time due to the Neopotism rampant in Mediator culture.  Since qualified can mean simply being a good friend of someone as opposed to someone who knows well about their very situation.

The highest power within their system are the Mediator diplomats themselves leader in practice, with their association holding much of the power despite the existence of the council who basically exist to work out the more civilian matters.  Of whom are lacking any jurisdiction over the military forces who act entirely independently. The council has its own private military force from the Mediators, but it isn’t able to consolidate their fleets due to the lack of staying power council members have.

The gestalt as a whole is viewed as the supreme consciousness of the mediators, with many of the diplomats encountered being vessels of this greater consciousness for part of the time- it’s seen as a pleasure and privilege to do so.

### Demographics

20% Cyrawaloc
8% Fosskemian
18% Vopson
10% Sarkic
39% Synthetic Entities
4.5% Other sapients
0.5% Megasynthetic Entities

The total population of the Mediator Gestalt is hard to know due to the shifting allegiances of the inhabitants, with a flux of 10% of the population on a regular basis in the ecumenical frontier regions. this lends to a population around 6.5-7 quadrillion separate individual minds who are part of Mediator space. This betrays the true biomass of their civilization, with is far greater than the population suggests.

### Tech

The Mediators make use of a vast range of biotech and growable technologies within a paradigm of biomineral processing that makes up the basing for their civilization’s tech.  Advancements have gotten as far as a primitive form of star lifting and dyson swarms developing in multiple parts of their society.
The vast scope of the Mediators is borderline incomprehensible for most human beings to even begin to understand.  They have memetic kill devices being common along with their mastery of biology allowing them to carry out all matter of fanciful activities with regard to synthetic biology.  Primarily in experiments to create a universal genome, an experiment they adopted from the Sprawl and hope to one day permeate across Prospect Space.

Organic life to the Mediators is something to be molded at will. There is somewhat of a sterility to Mediator civilization all tech as well that separates it from the Urzine who are similarly advanced but their embrace of Darwinian thinking makes them radically different in their usage of the same tech.
