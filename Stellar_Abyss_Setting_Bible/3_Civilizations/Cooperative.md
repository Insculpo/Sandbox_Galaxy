<h2>The Cooperative</h2>

### Overview

The Cooperative is a civilization descended from rogue peacekeepers who rebelled against the ancient terranic order whose highly centralized, highly hierarchal empire is founded upon the belief in a human spirit with the grand soverign’s guidance.

### Beliefs

The Cooperative as a civilization is one built around two sets of beliefs, that of a transhumanist hierarchal order that is viewed as a form of maturation within the meritocratic cooperative society. It is also built on the conception of a common human spirit that borders on theocratic even as AIs and Cyborgs run everything. The humanistic regime has a several other peculiarities, such as how their elite at times seems to view the common people like tending to a garden more or less and there is a strong natalist streak that has led to Cooperative space being flooded in the highest human populations in the universe, with the usage of artificial wombs regularly atop of life extension being widespread.

The Cooperative has been mostly ran by the grand sovereign, of whom being part of is viewed as of the highest honor, for it is the highest position attainable within the cooperative and means to those part of it eternal wisdom. Lesser soverigns exist in the cooperative as well, and those who become part of the grand sovereign usually come from lesser soverign in practice. Lesser soverigns not part of the cooperative, or think tanks have been utilized by organizations part of the cooperative for ages, indeed the cooperative as a whole originated as a peacekeeper force ran by what by this point would be viewed as a lesser sovereign. The cooperative’s political developments have shifted over time with the grand sovereign being less direct a force as cyborg oligarchs take on much more direct roles as the cooperative’s elite with their ideological and experimental outlook- with a sense of nihilism caused by copies of their minds already being uploaded many times over so they fear their own annihilation far less.

The Cooperative is pluralistic in its beliefs, with death being viewed as just death with having one’s mind uploaded being a privilege and nothing else and a very secular attitude where propagating human genomes is viewed as one of the top priorities of their civilization.

Culturally the cooperative is very socially libertarian for most despite the highly hierarchy civilization, with a sub-class structure of genetically modified people and the lesser cyborgized elite. Such hierarchal changes are arbitrated mostly by lesser sovereigns.
The Cooperative’s relations with other societies is a mixed bag of dealing with alien imperialists, degenerative post-terran associations and the silent Imperium in a complicated mess caused by conflicting interests within the cybernetic elite.

### Structure

The Cooperative is organized into a centralized force where the grand sovereign holds unilateral dominion over most human affairs. The cooperative’s presence for the common folk is that of a seemingly prevalent burning sensation with many people existing very insular, culturally desperate existences as if they were test labs even with the freedom of movement they can have... in theory. In practice, movement freedoms usually are limited by the standards system that acts as the universal value metric all people are judged by mainly through having to show their capacity for greater things through all matter of arbitrary testing by those in power who act as patrons to those lesser in the cylindrical habitat. The sub societies in the cooperative tend to be built on frame works created by lesser sovereigns and AIs who act on a more free plane where space travel and commerce is the norm.

The cybernetic elite is mostly known for being flesh humans whose exoskeleton is the cyborg they were from head to toe, with the internal body being partially replaced by synthetic components as well.

The cooperative’s military is descended from the peacekeeping corps, expanded into a sprawling interstellar institution that isn’t fully centralized, instead being a huge range of chapters that are under the command of lesser soverigns provisionally with the peacekeepers being known for how blurry civilian and military lines really are in the cooperative, as they also act as a humanitarian organization as they always have. The sector and regional militias are also quite common.

The humans of the cooperative live in a very wide range of habitation as per usual, with paraterraformed worlds, orbital habitats and all being utilized as places people exist.

As a sprawling civilization that even with the most advanced FTL accessible to any non-silent Imperium people takes years for information to get around, the Cooperative despite the unitary seeming power structure has a surprising amount of autonomy for those within the cooperative despite heavy handed enforcement. For the vast nature of the Cooperative makes it regionally have many, many conflicts with the Grand Soverign being some mythical figure for most of those within the cooperative as the numerous sub-states and world states of varying regional power who are considered subordinate to the greater cooperative and are protectorates of the peacekeeping forces of the greater cooperative.

### Demographics

There is one Grand Soverign of the Cooperative
There are a couple hundred lesser minds of varying capacity
10% of the population are full cyborgs on some level with copies of themselves in the silver net.
8% of the population is Tikali
1.4% is of other alien species
64% of the population are humans of some sort
9.6% of the population are uploaded minds with sapience or advanced AIs of some sort
6% of the population are various species of uplifted animals
The total population of the Cooperative is likely around 497 trillion people. Many of which born from artificial wombs.
And their overall space forces can consists of literally billions of spacecraft.

Fleet-
87 billion registered ships

### Tech

The Cooperative makes use of a very developed industry of cybernetics and biotechnology built from the wisdom of AI researchers cracking into the farther scientific reaches. The usage of power suits, AI networks and virtual nets is combined with the regular usage of artificial wombs and genetic tweaking to create various humanoids adapted to a wide range of environments. The Cooperative has achieved manipulation of weather systems and meta materials with the structural integrity to make megastructures and durable, robust spaceships/powersuits.
Their FTL consists mainly of warp drives, but they lack the developments of the blink drive and the diverse range of tech that comes along with that. Their warp systems are loosely based on the warp obelisks, but altered to get to 1-2 ly/day velocities with the usage of various acceleration points utilized by the higher echelons of society.
The Cooperative continues the use of fusion energy with wireless energy transmission, giving the cooperative the ability to support the massive human populations that their cybernetic elite so eagerly cultivates, allowing for large megapoli to develop over a million star systems.
