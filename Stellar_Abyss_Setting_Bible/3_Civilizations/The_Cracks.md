# The Cracks

Crack is a system of troubles which the Architect must deal with caused by rogue elements of their society.  Basically, they are into the sadistic desire to mutilate and malform everything artificial as some force of nature.  Their aesthetic beliefs make them a common nuisance and often viewed as much a fact of life as pirates or raiders are to most societies.  Their malcontent, vandalistic nature is why militarizing the megastructures are such a widespread phenomenon among the architect despite not having many wars.  The cracks tend to be societies in off themselves, acting in highly parasitic fashions and in highly grotesque manners as they have no regard for even their own existence, often fucking a lot out of leisure and letting their children do whatever instead of collectively raising them.  This does give them a very individualistic mentality not seen in most Aveterriat (who these groups tend to be, even if the Glinnvyr at times fill a similar niche).  The Cracks are terrible at their purpose of course, but cleaning them out is hard as they often tend to be very militarized.
