# Mediator Gestaltic

Mediator Gestaltic is the standardized language of the Mediator Gestalt.  It is called Mediator Gestaltic since it is derieved from the merger of Mediators and the Gestalt who both shared a lot from the Dominion.  They kept a more common pool of volcabuary, grammar structure and such than the Silverites who had standardized a completely different language.

There's no consist grammar rule, but some of the blocks of their language prefer to be prefix and suffix.  The relations of the parts also changes them meaning of the whole word considerably as well.  Keep this in mind.  Latinized forms of this language often will modify workflow in cases where the connections are too painful to pronounce.  

Being Utanguis, there's multiple scripts used and this is based more or less on the meditative format they use when interacting with other species.  The internal scripts are more cryptic and they have multiple that are used for different parts.  Mediators are especially deliberate in their use of scripts that need a full Utanguis to read in the order they're intended to be read- likely to stop other rival species from understanding them.

The relation pattern seemingly is that the latter a part is used, the more definitive of the whole word it is.  The crescendo format.  This is separate from the urzine fleets and their more authoritative method where the more definitive parts of a "word" are frontloaded.
