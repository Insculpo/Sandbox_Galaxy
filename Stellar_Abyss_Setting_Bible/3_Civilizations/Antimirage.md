# The Antimirage

## Overview
ï¿¼
The Anti-Ivoltic are beings who splintered from the main Ivoltic Group with the primal intent of isolating all from Ivoltic and leaving Ivoltic alone instead of harassing it all the time.  The Anti-Ivoltic actively Sabotages other Ivoltic groups by trying to subvert their systems by bringing in its own connected, who are in states of perpetual misery and depression and usually kill them selves in the name of destroying the ivoltic, as the anti-ivoltic collective explicitly wants to do.   The Anti-Ivoltic force one to see absolute reality and suppress all internal biases and as a result, break the will of many who interface too long.  

The Anti-Ivoltic is viewed like a cancer to the other ivoltic and has also caused numerous issues for other societies due to the rashes of mass suicide that usually happens when one exists too long around them as they flood minds with endless streams of depressing events from around the galaxy.  There's a fair amount too resistant to suicide, but only as long as they avoid thinking implications.  As with all ivoltic, the effects of the Anti-Ivoltic aren't predictable and the anti-ivoltic frequently must adjust its systems for whatever new psychologies it comes by and is known to be highly enthusiastic about using abductions to get this information.
