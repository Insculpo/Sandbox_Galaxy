Trisemblance is the name given to describe the system of government the Greater Systems Assembly runs their glorified coalition of colonies on.  It has the assembly defense force and assembly militias at odds, the presence of a massive union that acts like an elite technician guild in practice, the world ministries who elect representatives for planets that fill a unicameral congress with very little actual power compared to the cyborg oligarchs fueling rivaling organizations and the UAF's admiral being a political role at the same time the Assembly President robes around assembly volumes making decisions.  It gets stranger, such as how the Greater Systems Assembly maintains their own intranet of virtual servers that the plexus hacked into anyways they let control the legal codexes and do info gathering... Despite such crossing of networks being a loop hole in plexus neutrality.  Making the paranoia of VC infiltrators an irony beyond comprehension.
