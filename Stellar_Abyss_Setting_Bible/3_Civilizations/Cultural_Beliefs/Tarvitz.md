Tarvitz

Tarvitz is an Utanguis holiday which celebrate the long feast in the warm season and the long march afterwards.  This ritualistic holiday has been adapted to numerous contexts, the long walk and the long feast being done in either order though it is usually done with the feast first.  His long standing holiday has been practiced for ages and continued even as they became an empire, if anything their transformation to a space caring civ from prospector interference affirmed this holiday.  

Other features forge holiday include racing during the march, various festivities involving Dozin effigies and creating new Utanguis from mature enough spawn so they may join the feast which the whole herd shall enjoy.  This tradition isn't universal to the species, but it is quite widespread due to coming from the culture the prospectors uplifted first even if they uplifted all the Utanguis.  It was rather suppressed during the Cobalt but was brought back to life by the Dominion in their larger effort to revive the pre-contact culture of the Utanguis.  

Tarvitz is in a general sense a holiday whose roots come migratory patterns and these very patterns are viewed as symbolic of the holiday with the respective herd patterns on full display with incredible pride.  Other species may retain or lack this feature depending on who they are- other migratory species tend to adopt it for instance.
