# Yorlo
ï¿¼
Yorlo is a belief system from the highest hills of time and space, it is a belief system oriented in dilly hence to family and heart.  It is a belief system for the many and not the few, the common fealty of existence is thanks to the common knowing of Yorlo as it is said.  Which really means a common custom and social ritual for inter species relationships and the common case for a social cohesion even between biologically alien beings.  As if they were merely different cells within a greater body instead of alien foreign entities forced together.  It is a belief system which has compelled the Utanguis for ages, though it is often viewed in hostile terms due to its egalitarian message in stark contrast to the deeply hierarchal outlook of the Gestalt or Silver Legion where deference to authorities and observances are segregated.  It is the belief system that Wheelism in general emerged from.
