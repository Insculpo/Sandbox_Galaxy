## Biocollectivism (Metasyndicate)

Biocollectivism in the metasyndicate is one of the elements which the composers are most fearful of, as biocollectivism is an ideology based on the Ivoltic assimilations and seeks a softer form of it to make civilization more resilient to the influence of outside forces such as the ivoltic and more capable of empathy and care for others, be it alien beings or machines who are part of the metasyndicate.  The biocollectivists view themselves as essentially trying to make a system that stops ivoltic subversion by copying the "positive" aspects of the ivoltic, mainly their sense of interconnected was and ability to feel others to intimacy far beyond sex.  

As in the mind, emotion and senses become intertwined.  Their more spiritualistic aspects square off explicitly with the Metasyndicate and its traditionally materialist ways and while the biocollectivists do see room for individual experience, tend to be depicted as ivoltic agents despite usually being hostile to the ivoltic for their general destruction of individuality (while the biocollectivists believe they are making a superior form of individuality).  

Biocollectivism has also manifested in Ikeitans space, with a lot of emphasis on closing the gap between Ikeitans and others.  Regionally they have had successes, but often end up being attacked by both the darwinists and the harmonics who see biocollectivism as the death of the individual regardless and have deep concern for the privacy which is, to them violated by biocollectivism where closeness is the norm and not the product of individual agreement.  Really its depressingly similar an affair to stuff humans know all too well.
