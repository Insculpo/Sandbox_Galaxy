We're Lost, Very Lost [- Spaceship Quest! -]

Hello.

I am here to say we have no idea how to run a space mission.  We ended up thousands of light years off course and are now in some real alien territory.  So bad at this stuff we are, we've decided to get help from you, some random people the black box telecomm computer has us access.  We have no idea who you are, but your collective wisdom will be our salvation.

So, you must be really confused who we are, what sorta spaceship this even is and what time it is.

Well, we are part of the Hyadian Travels, a civilian tourist organization that has main office on the rather boring world of Kusneto Prime, where nothing ever changes.  So it was easy to get some people in on this.  Maybe not the best people, but they're people.  Some are human, others are an alien species you've never heard of.  They like underwater so cohabiting planets was easier with them, as long as you're okay about the pollution and don't dump radioactive waste into oceans you are fine.  I don't think anyone would ever do that, so that's good.  very good.  We'll explain them later since we got stuck with some of them.  

So it's like, what's the spaceship like?  It's a nice spaceship, a slender kilometer long.  It has a core fusion reactor, lots of space for energy cells since while we drift a lot the delta-V demands of a big ship can be annoying.  

Here are the ship stats for the number people:

-1 km long, 200 meters in radius

-Heavy Plating [1000 hp, tourist vessels have been notorious for their accidents so armoring them up this much is common]

-Fusion Reactor with [100000 Movement Points] (we'll discuss the mechanics of this later, don't worry)

-4 Defensive laser turrets [Interceptors, does 0 - 20 damage based on combat rolls]

-20 Nuclear Missiles [Explosive, 0 or 100 damage (no in-between as they can be intercepted)] (Standard thing for us, having a few nuclear missiles in a tourist vessel is better to have than not as you never know what might happen.  Besides you do know every spaceship no matter how civilian can be used as a WMD anyways, right?  Just saying, just saying.)

-Hydroponics [don't lose this or the crew starves]  

-100 crew members [70 humans, 30 Tikalis]

Mechanics

Variables
[Hp - Hull points, don't let it hit 0.
[Movement Points - Various actions have a cost of movement points connected to them, especially actions you vote on.  Try to find ways to gain/lose them.  It's not game over if this hits 0, but it'll be awkward.
[Damage - How much harm something does.  
[Roll - Some stuff has rolls connected to it.  Combat mainly since combat is meant to be a risky choice 
[Missile ammo - Missiles don't come cheap so they have limited ammo.

Special Attributes
[Explosive - Can hit other stuff besides the target, such as say intercepting multiple incoming missiles at once... Just an idea.
[Interceptors - Missiles that get close get interception rolls, can stop missiles from hitting you or fail and cause one to hit.

It's a rather complex galaxy, so let's just give you a couple articles relevant to what's going on.
