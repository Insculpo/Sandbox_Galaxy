# The Vus of Dozinian hierarchy

The concept of Vus (roughly translated to spirit) is one of the concepts that is comparable to other forms of universal spiritualism in the galaxy.  However, what deviates it heavily from the aveterriat conception of reincarnation is that it is a value judgement and a heavily hierarchical form.  It also is seen as an energy form, there's no reincarnation in Dozinian hierarchy.  Instead one finds a species merit system.  You act in the interests of your species to gain higher Vus within the system.  This Vus can be altered within one's life span and is seen almost like a currency more than something metaphysical- as if one gains more to bring the community as a whole closer to Dozin.  This mindset is where the internal conflict comes from as sectarian violence over what brings the community closer to Dozin has no census.
