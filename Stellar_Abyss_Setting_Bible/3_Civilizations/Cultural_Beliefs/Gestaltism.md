# Gestaltism

Gestaltism is a hierarchical ideology based on the idea of civilization being perceived in symbiotic, relationship based terms.  Interdependence is valued and there is a hierarchy with laws being very flexible, to the point where they are more or less ethics codes than laws.  This semi-lawlessness does not preclude the more imperial aspects of Gestaltism, which require the absorbing of new. Useful beings to the greater Empire and putting them to good use or finding them a place in the gestalt.  Cohabitation counts as a purpose to them, but they do expect you not to be parasitic or viral.    Gestaltism is heavily connected to Dozinism, but is not nessecarily the same thing as Antidozinists and Dozinists both follow some form of Gestaltism, as confusing as that may be.
