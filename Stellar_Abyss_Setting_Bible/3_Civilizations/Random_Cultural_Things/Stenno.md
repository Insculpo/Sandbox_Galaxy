# Stenno

The Stenno are a series of rock-like beings who have the will to rediscover the cosmos time and time again, reliant mostly on outsider volunteers to carry them to other worlds and a system of abilities to make this happen through influence and ambiguity for the Stenno tradition is a time honored Glinnvyr one which spread contagiously and rapidly across many species to the belief that these peculiarly colored rocks are living beings who need your help to transport them to new worlds to bathe in and wants you to bathe with it.  

They're said to be very intimate beings too, in some versions, in other versions scientific research on a Stenno tends to "prove" Stenno by finding bacteria on Stenno of unknown kinds from many different worlds, presumably due to the many worlds explored making Stenno a minor disease hazard or as others put it- the rocks with the diversity of the galaxy imprinted on them.
