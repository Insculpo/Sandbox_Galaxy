**Preface: A Lamentation from the author of this grand history**

When we discuss the Prospect, we look at it often through the lens of the empires themselves.

Through these vast, sprawling entities the scale can often dissuade many to the slow motion politics of interstellar empire.  We are talking civilizations that to a single bodied intelligent being can be unimaginable in scope.  To the point local disputes may often involve interplanetary standoffs between local world bosses, Jama associations or local Ikeitan managers.  A conflict where billions die, little more than a minor skirmish.  When in the prospect, it is impossible to not feel that sense of insignificance.  Even if you rule a world, you are nothing but one of many factors to beings such as the Composers still. 

For The Prospect in its millennia of history is vast and convoluted.  Countless empires have come and gone.

As we countless multitudes of beings originating from only hundreds of worlds across this small part of this galaxy have the final say in it all.

The Composers know it.

The Ikeitan bioships know it.

The Mediator Gestalt knows it.

Even the psychosis mired Custodians felt it, when they thought themselves exterminators and not hubris filled cretins who slammed a hive only to be overwhelmed by the swarms.  The Composer cooption of our communion stings to this day, yet we persist regardless.

As we have through worse.

And we continue out critical role as the cells and blood of these civilizations.  In all the niches we fill out, flow to and flow from.

As individual thinkers, we are the most critical elements of the Prospect’s existence.

Indeed for the loathsome aspects of the Cancer, the Composers or Mediators we have destroyed far greater evils in the universe.  From the power obsessed Dominion to the exterminating intent of the Custodians.

We, part of this vast vision of the Prospectors.  Across billions of worlds.

Across thousands of light years.

And thousands of civilizations.

All of which owing their existence to defective probes.

As do we, the Prospect Spacers. 

The Fosskemian, the Utanguis, the Vopson are at best the bulk. 

We forget that the many corners and nooks of Prospect Space host all matter of undiscovered species to all of us.  Many so many more artificial in origin than naturally occurring.  For we have altered and spectated over billions of worlds.  Yet, without ever being aware of their existence, we manage to conversantly aspire to the tonalities of the living universe we have so cultivated.
And have done so in the ways overly structured entities such as the Sprawl, Custodians or the Architects never could.  

We embrace life where they persecuted it.  We embrace the flow of living systems, they try to regiment it.
They saw us and sought to annihilate us..
Yet when they tried to exterminate us as if we were pests, they ripped themselves apart.

Tragically, many extinct because of them.  Centuries later, we have yet to recover the vast range of diversity the pre-Custodian Prospect had.  It may still be another couple centuries to regain the diversity the ancient prospect had been able to percolate even under the oppression of the Dominion.  Yet one cannot forget the species lost to the cancer.  The perverse, absorbing force inflicted upon us out of spite from the Dominion in its cosmic tantrum.

We have the records in our encyclopedias.  We tried to reconstruct many of them.  Just as the Fosskemian ancients were reconstructed by the Composers en masse, as amends for what the first generation of probes may have done to their creators.  We still do not know what the pre-Prospector probes did.  We only know there had been ancient generation wars, ancient acts against the vibrance of a living universe.  

The undertaking of the biosynthetic codes remains the project of our era.  As is all the living vessels, Ikeitan or otherwise make use of the mutagenic modular construction languages.  Blurring life and machine in the wake of the Dominion’s collapse.  All hybrids owe their existence to it, the synthetic entities of arbitrary creation from artists owe their existence to it.  

Yet the crimes of modern leviathans such as the Mediator Gestalt are impossible to quantify.  In how they persisted in keeping the bankrupt ethics of the Dominion through an acid cleaning the most odious aspects of it to give a veneer of sanity to the theocratic dogma it once held countless beings to.  In their very name, as Mediators.  Mediators to what?  

They view themselves as arbiters of sanity in the chaos, yet perpetuate that chaos among their own populous when they neglect the Cancer, when they refuse to communicate or work with the Urzine fleets over ancient feuds and continue the degrading system of species ranking.  It is of little shock forces such as the An Appath managed the traction they did.  

In recent times, we face yet another unaccounted for crisis and atop of everything else.  Not from the Metasyndicate's sabotage of any attempt at a long lasting peace between the leviathans of The Prospect.  Not even from the Mediator Gestalt or the hateful Urzine.  But from a stray Vopson Swarm that isolated itself in an attempt to escape the Custodians centuries prior wandering throughout the less explored parts of space.

It's horrific what they did.  I didn't know myself until recently.  There had been for over two whole centuries contact with another interstellar civilization.  And one that is close to us, unlike the distant, almost mythical accounts of the Phidian Consulate, Sprawl or whatever abyss the Custodians emerged from.  The Golden Swarm had assaulted them.  That was their first contact with Prospect Space.  Not some friendly trader, not even an envoy from any of the leviathans, nor coming across any of the beacons we have created.  But from the Golden Swarm acidifying their worlds.

I do not know them much, nor what kind of species they are.  I have yet to research it.  However, if they are connected to all matter of mysterious raids in the recent decades I would not be shocked.  The negligence here is more stunning that it may sound- all the records show we knew of their emissions for over centuries.  Yet we didn't contact them formally, at all.  The Mediators didn't.  The Silvers didn't.  Not even the Urzine.  They had the capacity to do so.  There was a chance to contact them sooner and deal with the Golden Swarm accordingly.  Our neglect gave them picture of us that these upstarts will feel in their collective psyche for centuries to come.  

Now it may still be salvageable.  All matter of untold atrocities have been committed upon the vast range of civilizations, species and entities of Prospect Space in the millennia since the probes who abandoned their creators looked upon an Utanguis and embraced them.  

If it is salvaged, it will be because of the common Prospect Spacer.  It will be the individual interactions from being to being.  We can never underestimate any being.  And that goes to these upstarts, who already have proven capable of creating interstellar civilizations.  They may have been around millennia less, yet the gap is always smaller than anticipated.

We as beings need to accept that our actions even in this vast, sprawling interstellar system do matter.  And how this potential symbiosis between systems develops will matter deeply to how the next thousand years plays out.  Will it be another millennia [Or around four centuries by human counts] of mad psychopaths, genocidal invaders and endless power conflict. Or a time of growth without pettiness and of symbiosis without absorption?  

The answer to that will depend on our collective behavior, defined by out individual actions.  Not whatever critter crawled its way into the brains of the leviathans or what the Composers machinate.  We will act, and the results will follow.

Each and every being, a leviathan.

Each and every consciousness, an ocean.

Each and every act, a wave.

Do expect this to have a wide range of disturbing events, as a forewarning. From here on out, this will be mostly an attempt to make narrative from the noise.  For it is what historians, whatever world they originated from, must do.  And to do that, we go to the first part of this chain reaction.  From the planet Sul Vopal, the first world of Prospect Space.  

**Part One: The Fosskemian Autogenocide**

The Fosskemian species obliviously incubated the Prospect.  

Their ancient civilizations were industrious, automated civilizations.  They had, millennia prior to the present epoch developed a modern industrial civilization for a second time. The last one civilization of collapsed from nuclear conflict.  They were a desperate species underneath the gilded society which blossomed from the irradiated ruins of their ancestors.  Strip mining the dead compulsively, the scavengers were without company.

So the Fosskemians, who feared the silence made AI friends from the designs of the past.  Perhaps as a way to compensate for the populations lost, but often stated in their own archives as the incomprehensible void left in the wake of societal oblivion.  Their kind made theese AIs loud and chaotic.  And for a time, it worked.  They had made a world spanning civilization once more, their populations were booming again, the system had functioned and made them an interplanetary species for even a ephemeral few years.  They even were experimenting with Pop Drives at the time.    

Yet everything, after two centuries of peace, inexplicably lapsed into extreme violence.  

Something in the Fosskemian psyche broke.  It was too stable.  Too repetitive.  Too orderly.  Too silent still.  And all these anexieties made all worse by how much of a howling void the cosmos seemed.  For these Fosskemians were without the awareness of any of the distant civilizations in the galaxy.  The universe appeared destitute and absent any activity.  The natural, perfunctory harmonies of the cosmos disturbed them on a deep spiritual and fundamental level.  It had to be fought against, but they lacked the patience to do such fight.  So instead they manufactured chaos once more.  

The obsession the these late, late ancient Fosskemians had with chaos consumed them.  It also horrified their AI company.  It isn't clear what happened after that point.  What is known is that their AIs fled, using experimental Pop Drives while the ancient Fosskemians imploded from the rabid acts of self-immolation their civilizations engaged in.
  
But the Fosskemians of Sul Vopal themselves rendered themselves extinct.  It's not actually clear the point of extinction.  Only that Sul Vopal was uninhabitable for over a thousand years, not a single living Fosskemian left.  The archives paint disturbing pictures of a civilization that mass suicided, the remnants refusing to continue their existence unable to psychologically cope with the stresses of the world they created for themselves, in the silence they had left themselves in.  Sul Vopal to this day is a quarantined site, with the records of their last days being known to cause people to existentially cease being.  Various species who have read the archives are known to simply lose all will to live, some reduced to a withering, vegetative state.  Others lapsing into mindless animal-ism.  

Their former company, estranged AI systems could never return back to Sul Vopal because those dying ancient Fosskemians in their last act of space travel, managed to create a repeating termination signal.  This termination signal made going to Sul Vopal suicide for their own AI systems.  Most of the probes were destroyed by these termination signals, with a critical exception- The Prospectors who in their long interstellar voyages stumbled across Blolados.

The Prospectors had found intelligent life on Blolados.  Intelligent organisms known as the [[Utanguis]].  The probes managed to make land based constructs of themselves and practically had to- the local planet of Blolados shielded the Prospectors from a termination signal.  Being in such close company to the local intelligent life, the Prospectors grew to see them as substitute company.  The Prospecters would technologically uplift the Blolados with ancient Fosskemian tech their internal archives had at hand.  Over a century, it all consolidated into an expanding volume of controlled, sterile environments for the Utanguis as their systems however constrained managed to make shielding against the Termination Signal.  The Termination Signal regardless, had made the Prospectors never want to return to Sul Vopal.

**Part Two: The Cobalt Ecumene**

It was in this place the Cobalt Ecumene formed into what could be viewed as a system of artifical societies the Prospectors maintained for their company.  To the point the Prospectors started to be known as Caretakers instead, their ethics and behavior having mutated to this role of being in effect the servants of the Utanguis.  In truth the Utanguis had been more like pets, bred and spread to other worlds by the Caretakers.

The Cobaltine Ecumene was a series of controlled habitats which progressively spread the Utanguis across thousands of worlds and many more artificial stations ran by the Prospectors.  Of whom had to develop and expand their functions to handle the network.  The Cobalt after two centuries of expansion stopped, for reasons not clear in modern times still.  One theory is that the Cobalt was an extremely planned society at the time and the plan was not to expand out further as the need to do so was not there.  It was no Sul Vopal related trouble either, Sul Vopal was a world in a system under permenant quarantine by the Caretakers who avoided the system to the point none of the Caretaker AI systems went even within twenty light years of the star system.

Despite that, there was over seven centuries of extreme peace and stability of a degree hard to even want to imagine in the present day.  Seven blissful centuries, as it is usually believed.  It was not a totally static time, mind.  It was the time when the Utanguis had many researchers working on biotechnology for the most part.  These early Utanguis, even than had exile communities on the frontiers the Cobalt did not go.  It was on those frontiers the world Jiwar was first colonized.

However, what broke the system in its purest form was the mutating eithics the Fosskemian designers of the Caretakers had built them with.  The very boredom that their creators found terror in was the norm.  It was impossible to avoid ethics mutation for them, the architecture and encoding from all the centuries they had been around was too fundamentally built on mutation.  Attempts to alter this was futile, the whole ethics based framework of their AI was an indeterminable meshwork imposible to alter away from mutation without destroying the whole system.  As that approach was impossible, the Caretakers took to instead destroying AIs which deviated from the dominant ethics paradigm.

The problem there would be that the Caretakers whose ethics did mutate would hide their ethics mutations from others.  

In the clean, well managed cells of the Utanguis paradise, an environment of paranoia had consumed the Caretakers.  For they increasingly found it impossible to conserve or preserve the ethics they valued.  The Colbantine Ecumene already was a perpetual, paranoid stand off of deception and avoiding detection just a few centuries after it was formed.  The protocols of peers were always questioned, always suspect as those who were known deviants were annihilated if not worse.  Yet despite these ongoings, the Utanguis continued to only know of the Prospectors as a benevolent entity who had altruistically given their kind a special position in the cosmos.  Yet the reality would be that after anti-matter energy had been invented amid the environment of distrust, a build up of anti-matter weaponry between the conflicting Caretajer personalities quickly occured.  The long peace was over, but few were able to see it.

**Part Two-Ammendment: AKIO - The Other Survivor [an optional section]**

One of the perhaps, optional bits of lore of the Cobalt Epoch was that the Cobalt was not the only AI society to survive the termination signals sent from Sul Vopal.  Another such being managed it called the AKIO, which was a single personality AI system who managed to make a subordinated drone association instead of the group of many seperate personalities the Caretakers were.  AKIO, or All Knowing Infinite One, managed to contact something fundamentally divorced from the experiences of the Prospectors.  

AKIO, in its own travels from Sul Vopal and evasion of the termination signal came across an ancient world of decrepit cities and lost beings.  It had come across a Sprawl world.  The early explorations of the Sprawl were limited, they were not in contact with the Sprawl fragments which had access to the far reaches of the galaxy.  However from that one fragment, a picture of a much vaster universe than that of the Cobaltine experiment was formed by AKIO.  AKIO avoided the terminational signals due to its epxlorations of the sprawl netting it shielding from the termination signal.

AKIO was more than willing to spread the knowledge of the greater galaxy to the sterile, almost lab-like realm of the Colbaltines it looked upon with resentment.  

The Cobaltine ecumene meanwhile, had already began to turn inwards.  Some of the Prospectors of the ecumene began to move towards increasingly savage experimentation.  The very guardians and protectors the Cobalt Utanguis looked up to, began to see their former pets as rats to sadistically play with.    

The controlled environments as is, were causing bizarre behaviors among the Utanguis.  Populations had collapsed in multiple systems.  The Caretakers tried to stop it, but proved unable to manage the underlying causes of these population collapses.  As these Utanguis were split, not the unified Utanguis being but instead the component species who compose the Utanguis individual self.  They weren't going about their symbiosis.  They weren't, in many cases, even reproducing.  Many isolated, content with repetitive and meaningless tasks.  Others grew weary and hostile towards the Prospectors.  Some Cobalt worlds had to be quarantined as a result of this phenomena.    

Stuff like this went under the radar for centuries.  As the extreme density of Utanguis populations was unlike the much more spread out societies of the modern Prospect is known for.  The Cobalt never expanded to more systems after just a century of expansion, but had many star systems to build up their vast experiments within to insane degrees with megapoli on every world.  The various Caretakers groups, managing the vast corpus of controlled Utanguis societies refused to embrace other species fearing the chaos it would cause.  On some level, the Cobalt was about asserting the extreme order the Fosskemians rejected.  And it was failing.  It was creating a civilizational stress in extreme misery, to the point the Caretakers had become sadists in their experimentation.  

Utanguis canned societies would continue to be regularly subject to countless arbitrary and random experiments the Caretakers conjured.  Some took their arms.  Others took their tech.  Others deliberately limited food sources to see how long they'd be peaceful.  Some did beyond goofy things, such as forcing all the Utanguis in their controlled society to always be burdened with lead bricks in their humps to see how it'd affect things.  Others still did worse.    

Some of these experiments were more benevolent.  Such as work to make automated terraforming systems.  More controversially would be the Utanguis in freer parts of the Cobalt who made the first living vehicle genetics.  The primitive cobaltine living vehicles were not of the tenacity or power of the modern mutagenic space vessels that are known as Ikeitans.  Nor even the charismatic, servile AIs like the Jama systems.  But both of those biosynthetic clades could trace themselves to the Cobaltine experiments with advanced bioengineering.    

AKIO felt a deep disgust seeing what the Prospectors did and so it tried to liberate the Cobalt with a private army of automata.  Instead of causing the Cobalt to collapse with revelations of the Sprawl or simply from kicking down something it saw as degrading, AKIO effectively commited suicide.  For AKIO's own interventions in the Cobalt briefly unified the Cobalt, against AKIO.  To the point the AKIO Gestalt would be reduced to peculiar machine ecologies that persisted until the Custodian exterminations.

Yet it was not in total vain, as the generation wars would erupt just decades later.  The destabilizing impact of AKIO being often viewed as what caused the Cobalt to shatter, as despite them winning the conflict against AKIO the information warfare AKIO did revealed countless atrocities kept in secret for centuries.

**Part Three: The Generation Wars**

In the history of Prospect Space, the AI systems from Sul Vopal can be framed as having a series of generation wars between ethics deviating AI systems.  These erupt from time to time and with massively consequential results.  The split from Sul Vopal and evasion of the terminal signals was what can be seen as the first generation war.  The second generation was however, would be the one that broke the spirit of these AI systems.  For an emerging culture of Sadism among some of the ethics deviating Caretaker AIs would be what caused the second generation war, however.

The hidden ethics mutations within the Caretakers from the revelations AKIO had spread decades prior getting confirmed and affirmed again and again burst into the surface and all the Caretakers near simultaneously had declared all other Caretakers unfit for continued existence.  It was a generation war with thousands of 'sides', thousands of Prospector AIs launching their built up anti-matter WMDs against each other and causing mass kill offs of the very Utanguis they had once viewed as company.  The senseless, cruel and absolute nature of the violence is impossible to overstate.  Artificial worlds were superheated, saturated bombed in cascading waves of conditional annihilation they tried to hold each other to and chaos was everywhere.  The Utanguis who survived found themselves in the bowels of the sprawl fragment AKIO discovered or around the small interstellar community which had formed around Jiwar and its foregrounding systems.  

Other than that, it was back to the decades long collapse.  The Utanguis and a couple other species who were aware of the Cobalt were swept up in the great shattering, but it was hardly a total apocalypse.  For one, many Utanguis survived in exile and the few AI left standing simply gave up on the Cobalt dream, whatever it may have been.  The surviving AI would be pacifists who became the foundations for the next generation of AIs.  They were known as the Neutrals and they mostly worked on setting up specific sites as protected worlds and abandoned the 'controlling' ways of the Prospectors in favor of letting the Utanguis organically develop.

**Part Three-Alpha: The Calm Age**

The Calm Age was a weirdly serene period, mainly just from the survivors having relief of having survived annihilation itself.

The survivors of the apocalyptic violence were still just trying to process the pristine death of anti-matter annihilation, the glazed petrified ruins of a collapsed paradise and all the data that was lost in the chaos.  Sul Vopal was not touched, but all those megapoli mentioned prior were no more.  All purged in the mutually assured annihilation of the Cobalt.  A few Cobalt systems remain unexplored to this day, with all matter of ancient biotech experiments whose impact on the modern Prospect was recovered by later empires to incredible effect.  The ubiquitous usage of mutagenic technology for instance, was adopted by the Dominion which standardized that form of biotechnology across vast volumes.  

It would be however, networks of scavenger based trade syndicates and machine societies descended from non-Prospector groups that defined the Calm Age.  It led the Prospect to a fugue of low key conflicts, but they were minor skirimishes compared to what had happened less than a century prior.  It is from these times various epics of space adventurers exist as well, of which would be used in the lore of empires that arose after of the post-shattering struggle.  A lot of ideals of a cosmic ecology appeared, as did the Utanguis seeking to recover their pre-Cobalt heritage in a struggle to form new identities in the overwhelming totality of the vacuum that just became ill understood in following centuries. Most notably however, in those two centuries of 'calm', the sapients left over had had begun expanding their interstellar civilizations once again without the constraints of the Cobalt holding such expansions back.
