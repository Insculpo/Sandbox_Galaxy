**Preface: A Lamentation from the author of this grand history**

When we discuss the Prospect, we look at it often through the lens of the empires themselves.

Through these vast, sprawling entities the scale can often dissuade many to the slow motion politics of interstellar empire.  We are talking civilizations that to a single bodied intelligent being can be unimaginable in scope.  To the point local disputes may often involve interplanetary standoffs between local world bosses, Jama associations or local Ikeitan managers.  A conflict where billions die, little more than a minor skirmish.  When in the prospect, it is impossible to not feel that sense of insignificance.  Even if you rule a world, you are nothing but one of many factors to beings such as the Composers still. 

For The Prospect in its millennia of history is vast and convoluted.  Countless empires have come and gone.

As we countless multitudes of beings originating from only hundreds of worlds across this small part of this galaxy have the final say in it all.

The Composers know it.

The Ikeitan bioships know it.

The Mediator Gestalt knows it.

Even the psychosis mired Custodians felt it, when they thought themselves exterminators and not hubris filled cretins who slammed a hive only to be overwhelmed by the swarms.  The Composer cooption of our communion stings to this day, yet we persist regardless.

As we have through worse.

And we continue out critical role as the cells and blood of these civilizations.  In all the niches we fill out, flow to and flow from.

As individual thinkers, we are the most critical elements of the Prospect’s existence.

Indeed for the loathsome aspects of the Cancer, the Composers or Mediators we have destroyed far greater evils in the universe.  From the power obsessed Dominion to the exterminating intent of the Custodians.

We, part of this vast vision of the Prospectors.  Across billions of worlds.

Across thousands of light years.

And thousands of civilizations.

All of which owing their existence to defective probes.

As do we, the Prospect Spacers. 

The Fosskemian, the Utanguis, the Vopson are at best the bulk. 

We forget that the many corners and nooks of Prospect Space host all matter of undiscovered species to all of us.  Many so many more artificial in origin than naturally occurring.  For we have altered and spectated over billions of worlds.  Yet, without ever being aware of their existence, we manage to conversantly aspire to the tonalities of the living universe we have so cultivated.
And have done so in the ways overly structured entities such as the Sprawl, Custodians or the Architects never could.  

We embrace life where they persecuted it.  We embrace the flow of living systems, they try to regiment it.
They saw us and sought to annihilate us..
Yet when they tried to exterminate us as if we were pests, they ripped themselves apart.

Tragically, many extinct because of them.  Centuries later, we have yet to recover the vast range of diversity the pre-Custodian Prospect had.  It may still be another couple centuries to regain the diversity the ancient prospect had been able to percolate even under the oppression of the Dominion.  Yet one cannot forget the species lost to the cancer.  The perverse, absorbing force inflicted upon us out of spite from the Dominion in its cosmic tantrum.

We have the records in our encyclopedias.  We tried to reconstruct many of them.  Just as the Fosskemian ancients were reconstructed by the Composers en masse, as amends for what the first generation of probes may have done to their creators.  We still do not know what the pre-Prospector probes did.  We only know there had been ancient generation wars, ancient acts against the vibrance of a living universe.  

The undertaking of the biosynthetic codes remains the project of our era.  As is all the living vessels, Ikeitan or otherwise make use of the mutagenic modular construction languages.  Blurring life and machine in the wake of the Dominion’s collapse.  All hybrids owe their existence to it, the synthetic entities of arbitrary creation from artists owe their existence to it.  

Yet the crimes of modern leviathans such as the Mediator Gestalt are impossible to quantify.  In how they persisted in keeping the bankrupt ethics of the Dominion through an acid cleaning the most odious aspects of it to give a veneer of sanity to the theocratic dogma it once held countless beings to.  In their very name, as Mediators.  Mediators to what?  

They view themselves as arbiters of sanity in the chaos, yet perpetuate that chaos among their own populous when they neglect the Cancer, when they refuse to communicate or work with the Urzine fleets over ancient feuds and continue the degrading system of species ranking.  It is of little shock forces such as the An Appath managed the traction they did.  

In recent times, we face yet another unaccounted for crisis and atop of everything else.  Not from the Metasyndicate's sabotage of any attempt at a long lasting peace between the leviathans of The Prospect.  Not even from the Mediator Gestalt or the hateful Urzine.  But from a stray Vopson Swarm that isolated itself in an attempt to escape the Custodians centuries prior wandering throughout the less explored parts of space.

It's horrific what they did.  I didn't know myself until recently.  There had been for over two whole centuries contact with another interstellar civilization.  And one that is close to us, unlike the distant, almost mythical accounts of the Phidian Consulate, Sprawl or whatever abyss the Custodians emerged from.  The Golden Swarm had assaulted them.  That was their first contact with Prospect Space.  Not some friendly trader, not even an envoy from any of the leviathans, nor coming across any of the beacons we have created.  But from the Golden Swarm acidifying their worlds.

I do not know them much, nor what kind of species they are.  I have yet to research it.  However, if they are connected to all matter of mysterious raids in the recent decades I would not be shocked.  The negligence here is more stunning that it may sound- all the records show we knew of their emissions for over centuries.  Yet we didn't contact them formally, at all.  The Mediators didn't.  The Silvers didn't.  Not even the Urzine.  They had the capacity to do so.  There was a chance to contact them sooner and deal with the Golden Swarm accordingly.  Our neglect gave them picture of us that these upstarts will feel in their collective psyche for centuries to come.  

Now it may still be salvageable.  All matter of untold atrocities have been committed upon the vast range of civilizations, species and entities of Prospect Space in the millennia since the probes who abandoned their creators looked upon an Utanguis and embraced them.  

If it is salvaged, it will be because of the common Prospect Spacer.  It will be the individual interactions from being to being.  We can never underestimate any being.  And that goes to these upstarts, who already have proven capable of creating interstellar civilizations.  They may have been around millennia less, yet the gap is always smaller than anticipated.

We as beings need to accept that our actions even in this vast, sprawling interstellar system do matter.  And how this potential symbiosis between systems develops will matter deeply to how the next thousand years plays out.  Will it be another millennia [Or around four centuries by human counts] of mad psychopaths, genocidal invaders and endless power conflict. Or a time of growth without pettiness and of symbiosis without absorption?  

The answer to that will depend on our collective behavior, defined by out individual actions.  Not whatever critter crawled its way into the brains of the leviathans or what the Composers machinate.  We will act, and the results will follow.

Each and every being, a leviathan.

Each and every consciousness, an ocean.

Each and every act, a wave.

Do expect this to have a wide range of disturbing events, as a forewarning. From here on out, this will be mostly an attempt to make narrative from the noise.  For it is what historians, whatever world they originated from, must do.  And to do that, we go to the first part of this chain reaction.  From the planet Sul Vopal, the first world of Prospect Space.  

**Part One: The Fosskemian Autogenocide**

The Fosskemian species obliviously incubated the Prospect.  

Their ancient civilizations were industrious, automated civilizations.  They had, millennia prior to the present epoch developed a modern industrial civilization for a second time. The last one civilization of collapsed from nuclear conflict.  They were a desperate species underneath the gilded society which blossomed from the irradiated ruins of their ancestors.  Strip mining the dead compulsively, the scavengers were without company.

So the Fosskemians, who feared the silence made AI friends from the designs of the past.  Perhaps as a way to compensate for the populations lost, but often stated in their own archives as the incomprehensible void left in the wake of societal oblivion.  Their kind made theese AIs loud and chaotic.  And for a time, it worked.  They had made a world spanning civilization once more, their populations were booming again, the system had functioned and made them an interplanetary species for even a ephemeral few years.  They even were experimenting with Pop Drives at the time.    

Yet everything, after two centuries of peace, inexplicably lapsed into extreme violence.  

Something in the Fosskemian psyche broke.  It was too stable.  Too repetitive.  Too orderly.  Too silent still.  And all these anexieties made all worse by how much of a howling void the cosmos seemed.  For these Fosskemians were without the awareness of any of the distant civilizations in the galaxy.  The universe appeared destitute and absent any activity.  The natural, perfunctory harmonies of the cosmos disturbed them on a deep spiritual and fundamental level.  It had to be fought against, but they lacked the patience to do such fight.  So instead they manufactured chaos once more.  

The obsession the these late, late ancient Fosskemians had with chaos consumed them.  It also horrified their AI company.  It isn't clear what happened after that point.  What is known is that their AIs fled, using experimental Pop Drives while the ancient Fosskemians imploded from the rabid acts of self-immolation their civilizations engaged in.
  
But the Fosskemians of Sul Vopal themselves rendered themselves extinct.  It's not actually clear the point of extinction.  Only that Sul Vopal was uninhabitable for over a thousand years, not a single living Fosskemian left.  The archives paint disturbing pictures of a civilization that mass suicided, the remnants refusing to continue their existence unable to psychologically cope with the stresses of the world they created for themselves, in the silence they had left themselves in.  Sul Vopal to this day is a quarantined site, with the records of their last days being known to cause people to existentially cease being.  Various species who have read the archives are known to simply lose all will to live, some reduced to a withering, vegetative state.  Others lapsing into mindless animal-ism.  

Their former company, estranged AI systems could never return back to Sul Vopal because those dying ancient Fosskemians in their last act of space travel, managed to create a repeating termination signal.  This termination signal made going to Sul Vopal suicide for their own AI systems.  Most of the probes were destroyed by these termination signals, with a critical exception- The Prospectors who in their long interstellar voyages stumbled across Blolados.

The Prospectors had found intelligent life on Blolados.  Intelligent organisms known as the [[Utanguis]].  The probes managed to make land based constructs of themselves and practically had to- the local planet of Blolados shielded the Prospectors from a termination signal.  Being in such close company to the local intelligent life, the Prospectors grew to see them as substitute company.  The Prospecters would technologically uplift the Blolados with ancient Fosskemian tech their internal archives had at hand.  Over a century, it all consolidated into an expanding volume of controlled, sterile environments for the Utanguis as their systems however constrained managed to make shielding against the Termination Signal.  The Termination Signal regardless, had made the Prospectors never want to return to Sul Vopal.

**Part Two: The Cobalt Ecumene**

It was in this place the Cobalt Ecumene formed into what could be viewed as a system of artifical societies the Prospectors maintained for their company.  To the point the Prospectors started to be known as Caretakers instead, their ethics and behavior having mutated to this role of being in effect the servants of the Utanguis.  In truth the Utanguis had been more like pets, bred and spread to other worlds by the Caretakers.

The Cobaltine Ecumene was a series of controlled habitats which progressively spread the Utanguis across thousands of worlds and many more artificial stations ran by the Prospectors.  Of whom had to develop and expand their functions to handle the network.  The Cobalt after two centuries of expansion stopped, for reasons not clear in modern times still.  One theory is that the Cobalt was an extremely planned society at the time and the plan was not to expand out further as the need to do so was not there.  It was no Sul Vopal related trouble either, Sul Vopal was a world in a system under permenant quarantine by the Caretakers who avoided the system to the point none of the Caretaker AI systems went even within twenty light years of the star system.

Despite that, there was over seven centuries of extreme peace and stability of a degree hard to even want to imagine in the present day.  Seven blissful centuries, as it is usually believed.  It was not a totally static time, mind.  It was the time when the Utanguis had many researchers working on biotechnology for the most part.  These early Utanguis, even than had exile communities on the frontiers the Cobalt did not go.  It was on those frontiers the world Jiwar was first colonized.

However, what broke the system in its purest form was the mutating eithics the Fosskemian designers of the Caretakers had built them with.  The very boredom that their creators found terror in was the norm.  It was impossible to avoid ethics mutation for them, the architecture and encoding from all the centuries they had been around was too fundamentally built on mutation.  Attempts to alter this was futile, the whole ethics based framework of their AI was an indeterminable meshwork imposible to alter away from mutation without destroying the whole system.  As that approach was impossible, the Caretakers took to instead destroying AIs which deviated from the dominant ethics paradigm.

The problem there would be that the Caretakers whose ethics did mutate would hide their ethics mutations from others.  

In the clean, well managed cells of the Utanguis paradise, an environment of paranoia had consumed the Caretakers.  For they increasingly found it impossible to conserve or preserve the ethics they valued.  The Colbantine Ecumene already was a perpetual, paranoid stand off of deception and avoiding detection just a few centuries after it was formed.  The protocols of peers were always questioned, always suspect as those who were known deviants were annihilated if not worse.  Yet despite these ongoings, the Utanguis continued to only know of the Prospectors as a benevolent entity who had altruistically given their kind a special position in the cosmos.  Yet the reality would be that after anti-matter energy had been invented amid the environment of distrust, a build up of anti-matter weaponry between the conflicting Caretajer personalities quickly occured.  The long peace was over, but few were able to see it.

**Part Three: AKIO - The Other Survivor**

One of the perhaps, optional bits of lore of the Cobalt Epoch was that the Cobalt was not the only AI society to survive the termination signals sent from Sul Vopal.  Another such being managed it called the AKIO, which was a single personality AI system who managed to make a subordinated drone association instead of the group of many seperate personalities the Caretakers were.  AKIO, or All Knowing Infinite One, managed to contact something fundamentally divorced from the experiences of the Prospectors.  

AKIO, in its own travels from Sul Vopal and evasion of the termination signal came across an ancient world of decrepit cities and lost beings.  It had come across a Sprawl world.  The early explorations of the Sprawl were limited, they were not in contact with the Sprawl fragments which had access to the far reaches of the galaxy.  However from that one fragment, a picture of a much vaster universe than that of the Cobaltine experiment was formed by AKIO.  AKIO avoided the terminational signals due to its epxlorations of the sprawl netting it shielding from the termination signal.

AKIO was more than willing to spread the knowledge of the greater galaxy to the sterile, almost lab-like realm of the Colbaltines it looked upon with resentment.  

The Cobaltine ecumene meanwhile, had already began to turn inwards.  Some of the Prospectors of the ecumene began to move towards increasingly savage experimentation.  The very guardians and protectors the Cobalt Utanguis looked up to, began to see their former pets as rats to sadistically play with.    

The controlled environments as is, were causing bizarre behaviors among the Utanguis.  Populations had collapsed in multiple systems.  The Caretakers tried to stop it, but proved unable to manage the underlying causes of these population collapses.  As these Utanguis were split, not the unified Utanguis being but instead the component species who compose the Utanguis individual self.  They weren't going about their symbiosis.  They weren't, in many cases, even reproducing.  Many isolated, content with repetitive and meaningless tasks.  Others grew weary and hostile towards the Prospectors.  Some Cobalt worlds had to be quarantined as a result of this phenomena.    

Stuff like this went under the radar for centuries.  As the extreme density of Utanguis populations was unlike the much more spread out societies of the modern Prospect is known for.  The Cobalt never expanded to more systems after just a century of expansion, but had many star systems to build up their vast experiments within to insane degrees with megapoli on every world.  The various Caretakers groups, managing the vast corpus of controlled Utanguis societies refused to embrace other species fearing the chaos it would cause.  On some level, the Cobalt was about asserting the extreme order the Fosskemians rejected.  And it was failing.  It was creating a civilizational stress in extreme misery, to the point the Caretakers had become sadists in their experimentation.  

Utanguis canned societies would continue to be regularly subject to countless arbitrary and random experiments the Caretakers conjured.  Some took their arms.  Others took their tech.  Others deliberately limited food sources to see how long they'd be peaceful.  Some did beyond goofy things, such as forcing all the Utanguis in their controlled society to always be burdened with lead bricks in their humps to see how it'd affect things.  Others still did worse.    

Some of these experiments were more benevolent.  Such as work to make automated terraforming systems.  More controversially would be the Utanguis in freer parts of the Cobalt who made the first living vehicle genetics.  The primitive cobaltine living vehicles were not of the tenacity or power of the modern mutagenic space vessels that are known as Ikeitans.  Nor even the charismatic, servile AIs like the Jama systems.  But both of those biosynthetic clades could trace themselves to the Cobaltine experiments with advanced bioengineering.    

AKIO felt a deep disgust seeing what the Prospectors did and so it tried to liberate the Cobalt with a private army of automata.  Instead of causing the Cobalt to collapse with revelations of the Sprawl or simply from kicking down something it saw as degrading, AKIO effectively commited suicide.  For AKIO's own interventions in the Cobalt briefly unified the Cobalt, against AKIO.  To the point the AKIO Gestalt would be reduced to peculiar machine ecologies that persisted until the Custodian exterminations.

Yet it was not in total vain, as the generation wars would erupt just decades later.  The destabilizing impact of AKIO being often viewed as what caused the Cobalt to shatter, as despite them winning the conflict against AKIO the information warfare AKIO did revealed countless atrocities kept in secret for centuries.

**Part Three: The Generation Wars**

In the history of Prospect Space, the AI systems from Sul Vopal can be framed as having a series of generation wars between ethics deviating AI systems.  These erupt from time to time and with massively consequential results.  The split from Sul Vopal and evasion of the terminal signals was what can be seen as the first generation war.

The second generation was however, would be the one that broke the spirit of these AI systems.  For an emerging culture of Sadism among some of the ethics deviating Caretaker AIs would be what caused the second generation war, however.

The hidden ethics mutations within the Caretakers from the revelations AKIO had spread decades prior getting confirmed and affirmed again and again burst into the surface and all the Caretakers near simultaneously had declared all other Caretakers unfit for continued existence.  It was a generation war with thousands of 'sides', thousands of Prospector AIs launching their built up anti-matter WMDs against each other and causing mass kill offs of the very Utanguis they had once viewed as company.  The senseless, cruel and absolute nature of the violence is impossible to overstate.  Artificial worlds were superheated, saturated bombed in cascading waves of conditional annihilation they tried to hold each other to and chaos was everywhere.  The Utanguis who survived found themselves in the bowels of the sprawl fragment AKIO discovered or around the small interstellar community which had formed around Jiwar and its foregrounding systems.  

Other than that, it was back to the decades long collapse.  The Utanguis and a couple other species who were aware of the Cobalt were swept up in the great shattering, but it was hardly a total apocalypse.  For one, many Utanguis survived in exile and the few AI left standing simply gave up on the Cobalt dream, whatever it may have been.  The surviving AI would be pacifists who became the foundations for the next generation of AIs.  They were known as the Neutrals and they mostly worked on setting up specific sites as protected worlds and abandoned the 'controlling' ways of the Prospectors in favor of letting the Utanguis organically develop.

It is impossible to comprehend the kind of torture and disintegration of consciousness, unmaking of materia, the prefiguring the Cobalt in those last desperate years during the generation wars did.  Even with the modern prospect and its faults, those who experience it in the absolute immersion projects can often be reduced to a catatonic state- they were often shut down as a result.  Some could handle it, barely.  Those often fall into self isolation and depression, unable to even look at the world around them.    

**Part Five: The Calm Age**

The Calm Age was a weirdly serene period, mainly just from the survivors having relief of having survived annihilation itself.

The survivors of the apocalyptic violence were still just trying to process the pristine death of anti-matter annihilation, the glazed petrified ruins of a collapsed paradise and all the data that was lost in the chaos.  Sul Vopal was not touched, but all those megapoli mentioned prior were no more.  All purged in the mutually assured annihilation of the Cobalt.  A few Cobalt systems remain unexplored to this day, with all matter of ancient biotech experiments whose impact on the modern Prospect was recovered by later empires to incredible effect.  The ubiquitous usage of mutagenic technology for instance, was adopted by the Dominion which standardized that form of biotechnology across vast volumes.  

It would be however, networks of scavenger based trade syndicates and machine societies descended from non-Prospector groups that defined the Calm Age.  It led the Prospect to a fugue of low key conflicts, but they were minor skirimishes compared to what had happened less than a century prior.  It is from these times various epics of space adventurers exist as well, of which would be used in the lore of empires that arose after of the post-shattering struggle.  A lot of ideals of a cosmic ecology appeared, as did the Utanguis seeking to recover their pre-Cobalt heritage in a struggle to form new identities in the overwhelming totality of the vacuum that just became ill understood in following centuries. Most notably however, in those two centuries of 'calm', the sapients left over had had begun expanding their interstellar civilizations once again without the constraints of the Cobalt holding such expansions back.  

---

Overall, the once great experiment of the Caretakers was reduced to a slaughterhouse of horrific experimentation and incomprehensible evils which ended in mutual annihilation of those AI systems, spare the few pacifist systems that went on the adrift in the cosmos once more.  

The Caretakers made perfection and grew bored of it.  They made utopia and willingly or not saw the fundamental failure of utopia, it was the state of death.  The mausoleum of civilization.  The second generation wars were worse than the first generation wars, as unlike the generation wars between the ancient machines and the Caretakers there was never a clear end point.  It simply petered away, dissolved away leaving the once dependent Utanguis stranded across various worlds.  One of which, the once enigmatic and loathed world of Jiwar which became the core of civilization after the Cobalt's self annihilation.

The Prospect in the collapse of the Cobalt descended into chaos.  From that chaos, came the Dominion.  

**Part Six: The Jiwarian Renisaance, Incubator of the Dominion**

It was the world of Jiwar where however, Prospect Space continued.  On Jiwar, a deeply regressive vision for civilization had emerged.  It had came from efforts to return to Blolados in the name of understanding the distant past of what their species was like.  A past romanticized on, a past before the Cobalt that was repressed.   

That is often the narrative, anyways.  For the Utanguis on Jiwar were made of those Utanguis despised the Cobalt, their societies were always in opposition to the Cobalt.  When they heard of the collapse from the despairing immigrant Utanguis who survived the collapse, there was celebration among the locals.  Yet there was still some changing of the narrative to the Cobalt as tragedy just due to a need to placate the Utanguis who had arrived in large numbers from the remains of the Cobalt.  And it would be from Jiwar the Dominion took shape and spread.  

The efforts of archeologists to Blolados in the Silent Age produced lots of records from a scattered array of Utanguis based civilizations that existed before the Prospectors ever uplifted the Utanguis.  A wide, scattered picture of pre-Cobalt Utanguis society that had been suppressed for nearly a thousand years had come to light.  This would be known as the Jiwarian Reniassance, and it would form the theology of the Dominion itself.  It would be what formed the being known as Dozin, of whom would pervade Prospect Space as easily the most widespread institutional faith in Prospect Space however much it has fragmented to this day.

In the end, The Dominion had been founded on propogating the being of Dozin after Jiwar underwent a vast centralizing project in the name of this vision of universal dominion that the tech existed for but was never commited to.  And Dozin, that ancient Utanguis deity which suppossedly had widespread following on the Utanguis homeworld of Blolados before the Prospectors arrived would be its symbol and essence.  In truth it was one of several belief systems the steppe societies on Blolados had, but this depth of knowledge on the lost home worlds was not well known.  Whatever the material truth, Dozin's cosmic order was to be applied to the whole universe wherever the Dominion could reach.

The egalitarian pretenses of the Cobalt were no more.  They saw the Cobalt's degeneration as the product of false security and the abandonment of Utangiun traditions.  The Dominion brought back symbiosis rituals, again with intent on universalizing their values even to alien beings where such symbiosis made no biological sense.  The universe was in discord and the Utanguis who had unified the local systems under the Dominion sought to bring about that harmony.

**Part Seven: The Great Expansion**

The Dominion rapidly expanded outwards from Jiwar, rapidly expanding beyond the ruins of the Cobalt, Sul Vopal, the Sprawl fragment and spreading further out still.  The FTL drive systems at this time had evolved well beyond the Pop Drives of Cobalt times and the Dominion had been able to make widespread manufacture of FTL systems for a large interstellar fleet.  Despite the scale of these fleets, the Dominion proved unable to retake the bulk of Cobalt ruins which they quarantined themselves.  The straggler AIs were pacifist, but they were extremely dangerous as well.  So the remnants of the Cobalt were isolated from the rest of the galaxy by the Dominion instead- chasing whatever AIs from the Cobalt they could to keep them from even thinking of getting in their way.

The Dominion in its expansionism uplifted a shocking range of clients, such as the Vopson swarms and the Whandl.  Both were sulfuric acid dwelling sapients that were integrated into the dominion .  The Dominion was a vicious civilization, and had been the first to institute a universal program of mutagenic technology.  A trend all civilizations of the Prospect would come to emulate, following the instruments set forth by the Dominion even if they move to different melodies and rhythms.  The deeply theocratic society of the Dominion formed in the collective trauma of the Second Generation War, watching those that they thought their care takers for centuries become their torturers.  They turned to their ancient myths, renouncing the sadism of these alien machines they once saw as the shepherds of civilization.  

The Dominion in their expansionism had pacified multiple species, brought them into the Dominion fold by force.  Forced them to adopt the institutions of the Dominion and under the judgment of Dozin's vision where their position was determined.    

The caste society of many species was viewed as part of the corpus of Dozin and the Dominion as the means to which Dozin assembles itself.  Everything a part of Dozin's body, a sprawling interstellar being that devours and consumes whatever is in its way.  Species were added to it, some like stomach bacteria, others like critical cellular components of the Dominion.  It held power through sheer ruthlessness and a near monopoly on interstellar scale violence across the many light years they had already spread loosely to.    

From the throne of Jiwar, where the pack representatives convene with the wisest ones a centralized empire had formed.  It had conquered much of the post-collapse Cobalt within a few centuries.  And would institute a loose peace for four centuries- various uprisings responded to with mass killings from RKVs and the use of Vopson thralls did break out but overall it was "peaceful" as far as imperial peace goes.  The rapid expansion put them into contact with more Sprawl ruins, which were actively searched.  The Dominion however, did have a tendancy to avoid ancient ruins more than engage with them, preferring to quarantine ancient ruins instead of explore them worried about what disruptive forces could be unleased from them.  Violations occured regardless, but the impacts were kept regional.

In that time of peace, the Dominion too began to experiment.  They picked up in some places the Cobalt left off- mainly the great terraforming projects their predessors attempted.  Ideally, the Dominion's biotech researchers had hoped to make a mega-organism to auto-terraform much of the galaxy.  The Dominionites in their Jiwarian chambers sought to twist that tool to make the ultimate WMD to forever put rebellious forces into submission.    

They called it the Cancer.  

**Part Eight: Colonial Resistance against the Dominion**

For after centuries of development, the dominance of Jiwar became a problem for the rapidly developing worlds who kept sprouting into their own societies seeking to break from the rigidities of Jiwarian Dozinism to form their own identities just as Jiwar had centuries prior.

Various Dominion clients had rebelled against the Dominion, time and time again.  No mass violence was able to end those revolts.  As many had at times, used the delays of time to build formidable forces.  Others had increasingly gotten used to Dominion procedures and methods, preempting deadhand RKVs or the nuclear rainstorms.  The Dominion needed something total, something only a psychopath could ever use.  Something so horrific to imagine even happening rebellion would always be met not just with annihilation but lingering, slow and perpetual sense of torment for opposing Dozin's will. 

And something no one the Dominion believed any group would risk seceding over.  

In spite of all their efforts, the Dominion had lost systems, thousands.  Not that many to the Dominion, whose presence domineered around millions of systems.  Systems they couldn't culturally control in particular grew away from them.  The Dominion traditions mutated rapidly, the faith of Dozin split into numerous subsets.  Most dangerous (at the time) were the Wheelist factions.  They were the most rebellious and an ongoing subject of persecution by the Dominion- worlds which had Wheelist control were often subject to annihilation if they did not submit to Dozin's will and to re-indoctrination.  Wheelism had been a sectarian opponent, which rejected the hierarchies of Dozin in favor of the cosmic wheel.  It rejected the vision of Dozin with its ranking favoritism and instead as all embracing, all loving.  Unconditionally.  The wheel as they saw it, was a network of life.  It followed a more ecological approach like they saw around them.  None was ever truly dominant, it was a revolving wheel instead.  It even went as far as to reject species castes.  

As one may imagine, the Dominion loathed them.

The Dominion was known to have experimented with mind control, but in practice this mind control was already undermined.  The control the dominion had was always shaky, innovations happened outside the control of the Dominion regularly.  They were at best, to many worlds an empire that rapidly degraded into a mafia which terrorized millions of worlds demanding submission to Dozin's cosmic order and their own power.  Be it worlds they had brought into their empire that were not of Jiwar or alien societies entirely.  Be it the colonists who grew sick of the orthodoxy or those who despised it from the start.  

**Part Nine: The Interstellar Jungle- Early Void Ecologies of the Dominion**

While the Dominion made foundations, those foundations sprouted a forest instead of the great tree they wanted.  Still, for all the evil of the dominion they proved to have some values.  One was they didn't ever want to kill off other species.  The mass acts of slaughter were often selective and they had claimed Dozin did care for all intelligent life despite all the different places such life had in the greater body of Dozin itself.

They created the Living Archives, a vast library of genetics and other 'scripts' as they viewed them that has been maintained even after major catastrophes.  They spread the archives far and wide, with the very mutagenic tech they used.  For they referenced organisms from thousands of worlds and the synthetic engineers of Dominion affiliation created living vehicles that could mutate and evolve.  This desire to spread life may seem at odds with the violence of the Dominion.  However the Dominion was always a contradiction- it sought dominance yet never went that extra step to completely conquer, it never resorted to total genocide of species.  The Dominionites forced their ways upon dozens of alien sapients they found, yet saw it as a means of creating their god more than domination for the sake of dominiation.  They truly did.

These Dominionites let ecologies of living probes from their own mutagenic technology self replicate.  They treated the ecologies like cosmic gardens to cultivate, picking the best synthetic creatures to integrate into their imperial machine as agents of creating Dozin.  This mindset had come from the Vilate, planimals who the Utanguis to this day have a strong affinity with.  For they, too were symbionts.  Those meshes of Insects and vines were able to take high ranks in Dozin's Hierarchy in the era of the Dominion.  Other lower order sapients were often viewed as of regional use or had a tolerated existence as inhabitants with no detrimental effects on the Dominion corpus to warrant being quarantined.  That wasn't always the case- some species were deemed too toxic and poisonous to the Dominion corpus and so were quarantined.  Most notably would be that of the Lasuuko, who were deemed a pest sapient at best and continue to the present day to be seen as such despite having less restrictions on their behavior.  Most however, are now extinct as an indirect result of the practice from *certain future troubles*.

One of the major reasons such ecologies grew beyond the understanding of the Dominion's own leviathan.  The leviathan was greater than the powers that be, the Conciousness of Dozin on Jiwar had little idea what was going on else where.  This issue was hardly a novel issue, as the scale of interstellar civilizations can be overwhelming.  And even with the vast bureaucracies centered on Jiwar and other critical worlds, the Dominion failed to truly ever have the degree of control one normally imagines with countries.  It progressively became comparable more to a Suzerainty than an empire as local organizations had progressively more sway than the immortal Jiwarian autocrat who claimed to be Dozin's very conciousness.  

Still, the Dominion's oppression was felt all too often and a thousand years into their reign the the Pilot's Revolt broke out.

**Part Ten: The Pilot's Revolt**

The Pilot's revolt was in many regards, the start of the cascade which ruptured apart the Dominion leviathan and ended the centuries of oppression they had come to represent for the beings of Prospect Space who had sought their liberation.

Prior civil strife in the Dominion had occurred, but none truly were able fracture the Dominion in a significant way outside of the Wheeler Revolts that were crushed mercilessly centuries prior.  The Dominion despite everything was good at keeping internal conformity amidst their central apparatus through Jiwar as a regular convening place.  With Dozin's Conciousness being able to arbitrate and act as the final say in all atters.  The Dominion had managed that for an impressive thousand years, even with threats from the post-Version wars feuding AIs who the Dominion used as a way to legitimize their power over clients or the challenges from Wheelers.

Those machines incidentally, in those thousand years mutated ethically more.  So much so even the Pacifists were extinguished and the modern Composer had begun to see its ancestors from these times.    

But the Pilot's revolt was different.

For the void ecologies had produced a class of bioships that rapidly was taking hold known as the Ikeitan Bioship.  They were not just powerful autonomous spacecraft, but they were intelligent spacecraft.  To the point the tradition of bioship piloting many Dominion Utanguis had practiced was deeply threatened by them.  To the point it caused a revolt from the Dominion seemingly being indifferent to the problem.

To the point a fleet of Dominion Bioship pilots took their revolt to Jiwar itself, causing a massive interstellar seige in the process.  The Wise One, Dozin's Conciousness tried to get the Pilots to communicate their grievances.  Their negotiations led to the Pilot's Deal.  It was a deal that shocked tons of worlds that had readily adopted the Ikeitan bioships over Dominion pilots in their logistics chains.  From Jiwar, the Ikeitans were deemed a toxic influence and a cancer upon the Dominion corpus.  The worst thing one could be deemed by the Dominion possible.  Ikeitans were reduced to the lowest positions of the hierarchy.  No Ikeitan was allowed to have input on those negotiations, as living vehicles were viewed as not intelligent beings anymore.

The late Dominion too, had abandoned what few positive values they had.  They began to purge Ikeitans across all of the Prospect Space, causing the Ikeitan wars.  It was a deeply violent time, but the Ikeitans had managed to escape the violence and genocide of the Dominion.  Dominionites proceeded to rampantly label various other intelligent vehicles cancerous in the process.  As the emergent intelligence among living vehicles, once embraced had been turned against by the Dominionites for the discord it caused.    

That unilateral act caused widespread unrest and secession conflicts across millions of worlds.  

The exiled Ikeitans already came to loathe Dozin itself as the symbol of all their suffering, the god that abandoned them.  For this was what happened after everything they had done over prior centuries to prove their worth in the system, being told they were cancer.  Needless to say, the consequences of the Pilot's Revolt and their Deal to this day have shown no signs of healing.  

The deep seated hatred of gods formed the Foundations of the Ikeitan worldview in the Urzine Domain and the more fanatical Balch.  The Pilot's Revolt and its consequences also was the beginning of the end for the Dominion, which had found itself across its entire volume losing territory to defection after defection.  Because the intelligent vehicles the Dominion had targeted proved critical parts of many of these societies.  The Dominion was mutilating their very infrastructure, it was unacceptable to local societies to carry these atrocities out in the name of Dozin.  Those groups needed the living vehicles who had formed the back bone of the Dominion more than the Wise had ever known in its Jiwarian echo-chamber.    

**Part Eleven: The Ultimatum and the God Slayer**

As the Dominion faced widespread secession, an ultimatum would be made.  It was a simple ultimatum:

All must submit to the will of Dozin or all of civilization would end.  

It was not taken seriously.  It was viewed as a bluff.  

But the cancer was very real.  The will of Dozin was being challenged across millions of worlds and some of these revolts had begun to directly target Jiwar and the hierarchy of the Dominion itself.  the God Slayer had appeared as an ongoing figure of much myth in this time.  Some say it was an Ikeitan collaborator, no one is sure.  It had killed dozens of pack masters who convened with the Wise on Jiwar, it had managed to infiltrate Jiwar itself.  The God Slayer didn't understand the cancer much, but learned of it and only became more vindicated in its efforts.  

No one is sure if the God Slayer was an Utanguis, a vengeful Ikeitan, a Vilate, some Whandl or other higher species in the Dominion hierarchy.    

The God Slayer's goal of killing the Wise however, had an ambition to it that few never got close to.  The God Slayer ultimately failed as well, it detonated a micro-antimatter bomb on Jiwar itself where it thought the Wise was.  It missed, mostly.  

The Wise was a distributed mind, after all.  The God Slayer thought it had annihilated all of the Jiwarian autocracy in its entirely.  It only got a fraction of its consciousness.  

But that was all the God Slayer needed to do.  The God Slayer committed suicide when it knew it was compromised on Jiwar.  The God Slayer achieved the impossible. The God Slayer did what the Ikeitans, Wheelists or numerous secessionists and rogue pack masters could ever dream of.  Make the Wise look vulnerable.  Break the illusion of Dozin itself in a way that it could never recover.  

**Part Twelve: The Leviathan Collapses**

As the Dominion lost all composure in the God Slayer's 30 year run of killing so much of their apparatus, if there was a single assassin or a group no one knew.  They were extremely secretive an organization and disbanded after their micro anti-matter bombing.

With little to lose in the minds of Jiwarian elites, the cancer wwas be unleashed in retaliation for the God Slayer's actions.  It did not help that there was already deafening stress of the intrusive marauders nearing Jiwar itself.  Thousands of worlds of prime rebel activity were targeted.  All negotiations and diplomats from rebels were cut.  Others killed.  This had become the largest scale murder suicide in known galactic history.  Dozin's will was violated.  The Cancer had to be spread.  It was terminal.  They had to purge an undeserving universe. 

The use of the Cancer xenoformed thousands of garden worlds into chlorine filled hell worlds that spread to this day.  Attempts to clean the cancer have reduced the worst of it, but it was impossible to stop its spread early on.  The kind of terror the cancer caused at the time can be hard to express.  As it was something that existed to reduce the biospheres and void ecologies of the galaxy into mush.  The precieved danger the Cancer represented was so great that it is one of the theories for why the Custodians wanted to wipe out the whole Prospect (they purged cancer worlds along with non-infected worlds in their rampage).  

It was all in vain, however.  For just a couple decades later Jiwar itself fell under control of rogue pack masters who sacked the Wise's palaces and killed off all parts of the ancient dominion Wise.  

Other parts of the Dominion would from their remaining pack masters become what would be the Silver Legion while others tried to reform the Dominion with the creation of the Mediator Gestalt- which has lineage to the Dominion despite their more secularized pretenses.  The Mediator Gestalt still use species ranking, for one.  

More disturbing groups would include the Bilethought, which were Dozin fanatics who became enamored with the Cancer itself.  They aspired to the faithful execution of Dozin's will and worship the Cancer itself as Dozin's ultimate gift to the universe.    

The end of the Dominion despite all the scorched earths, was still widely celebrated even by the societies that drew lineage to the Dominion.  Even a century later in the chaos of conflict that emerged, many Prospect Space denizens prefered that instability over the oppression of the Dominion.  For the actual Prospect Space had its roots here.

**Part Thirteen: A Brief Freedom** 

The various bouts of violence from post-Dominion loyalists after Jiwar was conquered by the Tommik pack masters kept things violent.  The Militant AIs had become more aggressive in this environment as well, abandoning the conservatism of Neutrals who simply ceased to be, folding to Militant ethics in a bloodless generation war.  Meanwhile the Ikeitan bioships who managed to carry out their Exodus began rim conquests, the Urzine Domain's ancestral fleets seemed to see themselves as just another actor in the vast game of interstellar warfare which defined the Violence.  

Yet underneath that environment of open warfare was a more peaceful, communitarian world.  One which spread Prospect Space and kept it growing, even with the periodic reaping of the violence.  This often ignored part of the Prospect had resisted the Dominion for over a thousand years.  Beings such as the Sarkic on ammonia rich worlds who connected to Jovian Minds, the Snoflolos who lived in the kuiper belts as cyrophiles whose ice mining made them incredibly prominent a face, the Lasuuko who labored in the lower rungs of society as both a pest and critical element of numerous planetary economies.  Countless others existed.  All Prospect Spacers to this day.  Others however, such as the Mjaza, Quvakar and Pasis, were wiped out in the Custodian invasions.  

Even beings like the Utanguis, Vilate, Vopson and Whandl, with their association to the Dominion as the 'high' species of the Prospect in the Dominion Era's Dozin ranking system had many members who existed as part of these various sub-factional entities that kept the ecologies of Prospect space motoring even as those running things aspired to anarchy.

In this time, the hundred million or so worlds that had colonies expanded out rapidly which was one of the major vectors of conflict in this time, the waves of second wave colonizations over stars which the Dominion overlooked in favor of more habitable systems.

**Part Fourteen: The Custodian Extermination**

It was in (the human year of 2174) when the first Custodians appeared and began to destroy world after world.  It was sudden and in the middle of massive infighting.  And the first resistance they came across would be that more peaceful, connected society underneath which the violence rolled over.  They managed to fight the Custodian forces to some effect, even managing to destroy some of their drones.  But not before billions of Prospect Spacers were obliterated.  A vast number that betrays how Prospect Space had a population of nearly quadrillion sapient beings already even with the horrors of the Dominion that briefly dropped populations.  A few billion lost still was shocking, simply from how that much death occurred within a month.   

The situation lead to a shaky coalition by the warring factions, who had to combat an alien force that exterminated its opponents instead of played games.  Early efforts were hopeless, the Custodians never played by any rules.  The Custodians attacked from hyperspace, they hit and ran with anti-particle streams.  They warped in relativistic projectiles.  The threat was a completely out of context one for Prospect Space.  

Indeed, many accounts at that time had been convinced Prospect Space was no more.  That extermination was inevitable.  

Such accounts underestimated the adaptability of the ecologies of Prospect Space- the vast jungles of living technology which festered about Prospect Space proved an ongoing issue for the Custodians who never knew what to target outside the infrastructure on planets.   

And it was in that time that research into Sul Vopal by some militants, perhaps seeking to run further away, unlocked a whole way of thinking by breaking with the taboos of the past.  No termination signal could affect them anymore either way.  The militant probes at Sul Vopal became part of what became the first Composers.  They developed with the Ikeitans who also had taken refuge there and made a whole new kind of entity.  The enigmatic Composers.  Working through Cobaltine and Sprawl ruins.  These beings managed to adapt a lot of new tech that had been worked on since the times of anti-Dominion resistance, but now had direct imperative to use.  

Meanwhile the lower order beings of the fugue proved harder and harder to wipe out for the Custodians, who had assumed an easy extermination.  They didn't expect them to root so deep into worlds that should have been absolutely uninhabitable, so vicariously disregard their own livelihoods or find ways to instinctively know when a hyperspace portal was about to open.  The Custodians misunderstood the Prospect Space situation.  They thought they were dealing with a civilization already in terminal decline and collapse.  They thought that they were just cleaning up what was left of them.    

How deeply wrong the Custodians proved themselves to be.  Still, the Custodians continued their war of extermination.  They figured more applied force would overcome the weeds of the Prospect.  
  
But things just got more unpredictable in the Prospect instead.  

**Part Fifteen: The Rise of the Composers**

The shock of the Custodians began to reveal the adaptability and tenacity of Prospect Space in ways only imagined before.  This wasn't the tedious and easily fractured Cobalt or the centralized, Gestalt mind dependent Dominion.  It was a system that perpetuated an interstellar existence without needing critical industries.  It was both ecology and civilization.  A force without need for a head, a networked garden of beings who kept persisting and adapting to their exterminator's methods faster than these Custodian exterminators could change their strategies.    

More fascinating, however, was how the Composers initiated projects to mass resurrect the Fosskemians.  They were as a species, mostly a novelty, a minor species in the grand scheme of the vast civilization the descendants of their own AI created.  Yet the Composers had felt compelled to bring them back in massive numbers.  Many died to the Custodians, others survived and persisted.  They proved great disposable fighters against the Custodian death machine.  The Composers had from the ancient Sul Vopal records known that the Fosskema would have an instinctual hatred for the Custodian invaders.  They didn't fear death, only silence.  They would fight with tenacity and never bother with hiding.  Many flash cloned Fosskemians were used as part of personal Composer armies in these times.

The Custodians were, despite being from a civilization millennia more ancient, completely out of their depth.  And they never would have the resources needed.  The distances were vast, there was an ecology of cooperation and resilience against their violent intrusion.  Worse still. the Composers had managed to prove able to distribute innovations that blindsided the Custodians.  One notable such development was the Composers finding ways to track Custodian drones through hyperspace back to the wormholes they had used to setup their toe hold in Prospect Space to begin with.

The Custodians had perhaps, one slightly 'positive' impact- they indirectly opened up Prospect Space to the existence of the Architect.  There had been beings Sprawl explorers thought was just other Sprawl inhabitants who turned out to be members of a contemporary civilization tens of thousands of light years away from Prospect Space.  In a whole different quadrant of the galaxy.  

Connected primarily by the Sprawl and Custodian violence.  

But Prospect Spacers severed those wormholes out of nessecity.  The Custodians threatened the vibrancy of Prospect Space, they threatened the harmony of the galaxy and had to be pushed back.  Such actions managed to make the Custodian situation worse, as the attack, while costly for the Prospect (many, many Prospect Spacers and Composers died in the wormhole raids) managed to cause something spectacular.


Thee Custodians and what beings that backed them were realizing Prospect Space was not really the primitive, biotech and AI addled failure that needed to be purged from the galaxy.  They had become entangled in a force indeterminable and impossible to annihilate.

Still, the invasion continued into the next phase, where they directly targeted the Composers instead of purging life.  In the view of the Custodians, the Composers were orchestrating everything.  The Great Wormhole Raids were a Composer plot.  The Composers had to be destroyed.    


**Part Twelve: The Diasporias and Retreats**

It was in this time that Ikeitans managed to use wormholes in the Sprawl to go all the way to the Architect and the Golden Swarm flew off to the depths of space to later terrorize the Terrans (in the human year 2440).    

Many other Prospect Spacers however, stayed.  Instead digging into planets, derelict ruins and the depths of worlds such as gas giants or water worlds.  Some even took up shop in Brown Dwarves.  The Custodians found some of these, but would ultimately find they were not just hiding but instead engaging in hit and run tactics to make it hard for the Custodians to focus their exterminations on major worlds.  The siege of Jiwar was a major example of these depth hits, using asteroid belts regularly as bases of operation where they coordinated attacks using quantum comm systems the Composers had given them.    

The vast cooperation of Prospect Space in the Custodian invasion seems unimaginable considering the prior infighting, until you recall how those factions were not the dominant force of Prospect Space but instead simply a part of it.  And that the whole Prospect Space being is a complex of over millions of worlds freely associating with each other with the leviathan empires just being emergent power structures that come and go as the aggregations of cells they are.    

The Custodians simply at some point around (2320 in human years) retreated.  Yet still have activity in the quadrant to this day, but operations on the scale of the Custodian Invasion have been completely absent.  Why they stopped so suddenly is one of the subjects still being explored to this day, as the factors seem more complex than once thought.  The original theory was that the Custodians realized they weren't exterminating the Prospect as fast as it was able to grow and adapt.  However, they easily could have sent more forces even after the Great Wormhole Raids revealed the Custodians weren't the omnipresent exterminators they first seemed to be.    

Later times would reveal that these Custodian invaders were part of a massive virtualized civilization of solipsistic entities who view this universe as one of countless others part of their greater metaverse.  And that the Custodians had many other enemies beyond the Prospect.  That led to a more cynical theory- where the Custodians were stuck dealing with other forces like the Larona, other Architect dwellers like the Chromatists and sprawl connected beings like the Dioviermes in the greater galaxy.  

**Part Thirteen: Traumatic Legacies**

The legacy of the Custodian Invasion is that of tribulation.  Over 30% of Prospect Space was lost in the invasion, including numerous factions, species and worlds.  That 30% statistic can diminish just how much death occurred.  We are talking hundreds of trillions of self aware beings obliterated.  Millions of worlds worth of infrastructure destroyed including the Utanguis home world of Blolados.  Many of Prospect Space's interstellar ecologies were also ripped to shreds.   

Amazingly, Jiwar barely survived and Sul Vopal was already a ruin.  The amount of devastation only in the past century has shown much in the way of full recovery.  The cancer was able to spread to many more worlds post-Invasion, with most forces focused on rebuilding.  Many communities in Prospect Space however, remain in hiding from Custodians to this day convinced they will come back to 'finish the job'.  

Not helping is the existence of roaming Custodians already in Prospect Space, given deep suspicion from the numerous Prospect Spacers who know their past genocidal intents.  Those Custodians are known to also engage in ongoing shadow conflicts with the Composers or even Ikeitans to this day.    

The collective trauma of the Custodian invasions did eventually wear down, even if the failed extermination is among the many horrors which have haunted Prospect Space to this day.  It is all too common to accidentally stumbling upon isolated communities paranoid and violent who still exist as if the invasions are still occurring, terrified to be discovered and compromised to the Custodians.  Or to have a custodian drone that gets into a regional space skirmish with local world defense fleets even if the drone is supposedly there neutrally.  There just is no trust for Custodians in Prospect Space, for good reason.

A large share of modern Prospect Space societies can either trace their origins often to a time just before the Custodian invasions or after it.

And in those centuries, the Composers would begin to work Prospect Space to their vision of civilization.  In all its harmoniousness, against the silence and without disintegration.  And with the Fosskemians brought back in vast numbers in a civilization where space has given away to a vast galactic community known to exist, the complexity only expanded from this point onwards.

The Prospect Era will be the last chapter, beyond which all Prospect history becomes regional instead of this overview. 

**Part Fourteen: The New Leviathans**

In the wake of the Custodian invasion, the universe had seem to become to an absolute existential standstill for Prospect Space.  They had achieved the impossible struggle for their existence, but found their civilization left with nothing but an incoherent mire of leveled worlds, paranoid psychopaths, the Composers doing as they do and millions of worlds in total cascading ruin even without the Custodian terror.  That sense of Pan-Prospectism which seemingly was cultivated by the Custodian invasion was a best a temporary phenomena.    

Yet little did any of these entities know, they would become the unwitting creators of a multi-polar system of Leviathan Empires that expanded rapidly in insitutional complexity from the numerous organizations and freedom that would be achieved without any Dominion or Custodians in the way of it and Composers who enabled it.

Old rivalries between the Ikeitans and post-Dominion Dozin worshipers were the first to break the post-Custodian peace.  The issue of the Cancer had once more come to the fore, as did the founding of the Mediator Gestalt.  The Mediators structurally proved similar to the Dominion despite having a culture of secularism and fair arbitration, along wih more meritocratic pretenses than the Dominion ever did.  They are often accused of following Dozinian species hierarchy, one of the institutions that in post-Custodian Prospect which had become widely loathed.  

The older Ikeitan fleets would in the wake of the invasion unify under the Urzine Domain, their fleets having spent the Custodian Invasion evading custodian drones while others rushed to the Architect for causes unknown.  Isolated from the greater conflict stewing in their own thoughts in brown dwarves and jovian worlds orbiting overlooked red dwarves, yet remaining numerous enough to be a powerful force.  Internal conflicts between the flotillas would eventually lead to confederate entities and Urzinian Federalization. 

There was also the Fosskemian question.  A whole species was brought back from extinction in vast numbers who were removed from their original civilization in all but their biology.  They were clones meant for a suicidal war of attrition to buy time against Custodian invaders by being zealotic personal armies for the Compposers.  Now they had no war and were incredibly homogeneous genetically as the back ups were never made with populations numbering in the trillions in mind.    

That being said, the initial hopes the Mediator Gestalt had of being able to simply recreate a dominion-like super power fell apart rapidly.  Other pack masters had already consolidated into forces such as the Silver Legion who sought a society of battle thralls in their own militarized outlook formed over the centuries.  Meanwhile some post-dominion groups fell to the cults of the Bilethought which sought to spread the Cancer instead of purge it.   

**Part Fifteen: Entropy Worship**

The situation was incredibly degraded, needless to say.  

While technology had advanced, society was still sliding to a new kind of darkness from the forces of Prospect Space as a system overtaking what semblance of organized society once existed.  The power of interstellar governments greatly corroded in the Composer manipulated systems of post-Custodian Prospect Space.

Societies had become much more nihilistic.  The Ikeitans from that ancient Exodus had consolidated into becoming a powerful force that actively threatened the interests of those who still followed Dozin.  New Vopson swarms had begun to emerge, with a cleverness about them that made them harder to regiment than other historical rogue factions like the Whandl dominated Platinum Unit of  the Dominion Era.  The Pale Swarm had in its own region built vast populations in the depths of numerous worlds after barely surviving their ancestral swarm being purged by Custodians.  The Glowing Swarm, which had been related to the Golden Swarm meanwhile accepted the hierarchy of Dozin, but saw themselves as on top of the Dozinian hierarchy and everything else as slaves to Dozin's angels.    

Than there was the Composers themselves and their own projects.  They had developed pet societies, but they were much more loose and less managed than anything their Caretaker ancestors had with experiments made to go out of control by design as stable experimentation disgusted them.  They had various short lived proto-forms of the Metasyndicate emerge, many of them personal Composer fiefdoms.  The cloned Fosskemians proved much more rebellious and unstable, making societies such as the Waywardian Union which actively resisted the influence of Composers and had to go to war with Composer influenced Vopson swarms before long.    

Other Fosskemian groups went reactionary, such as the Hargonian Empire that attempted to recolonize Sul Vopal and worked to de-extinct large shares of Vopallian wildlife.  But the Hargonians in that brief occupation had to abandon Sul Vopal and quarantine it because their surveyors had began attacking and assaulting princesses.  Vopallian archives even millennia later, proved a deadly read.  Some in the Metasyndicate still managed to make copies of it as a means of information warfare that had proven incredibly destabilizing.  The Hargonian Project rapidly fell into a humiliating shell of its former self, toyed with by the Metasyndicate instead of being an actual power to reckon with. 

Even the Urzine Domain, once formed found itself within centuries to have a secession attempt in the form of the Balch, a fleet that went down a path of extreme radicalism against all things Dozin and are a ticking time bomb for the whole of Prospect Space.  The Urzine-Legion wars being perhaps the most volatile conflicts within the past couple centuries of the Prospect.    

Other issues, besides the looming trouble of the Cancer include other biosynthetic actors such as the Ivoltic ecologies whose various strains actively aspire to force emotional states among all those part of their networks.  The Ones who Love, the Ones who Hate being the most dangerous groups.  Thankfully, they don't get along.  

There are also ongoing shadow conflicts with Architect forces that underlie the whole Prospect.  With the sense of other nebulous dangers in the galaxy always present in the consciousness, yet never immediate enough to mend the fractured mess that Prospect Space appeared to be.  

That is, appeared to be.  

**Part Fifteen: The Dark Matter of Civilizations**

Since there is something that can be called the Dark Matter of civilizations that kept it all going in spite of everything.  The Ikeitans, Composers and such had shared interest in cultivating the civilization after all.  But they knew they did not need large empires to do it and didn't want them- they saw them as a strangling factor.  

As is, putting a specific timeline on these developments is hard without the passage of time to weed out the actors who prove least relevant.  The machine swarms that persisted into the Dominion Era, the Neutral reserve networks, the Platinum Unit or the Jovian Mind polities that the Dominion never could acutely conquer, for instance barely got coverage since they were at best historical antiques of bygone eras.  

Still, navigating the complex web of Prospect Space societies remains difficult for the historical legacies of bygone eras which color so much of the modern Prospect.  That is why a specific chronology is hard to articulate.  There was a brief several decades where not much happened after the invasions, some more decades when various hiders started to crawl out contemporary with the establishment of modern Dozin worshipers like the Mediators or Silverites, than it gets much harder to follow.  

Yet one should note, for all this talk of a bitterly broken, divided world where multiple species dominate different factions there are still attempts at alliance and coalition building.  Like the attempts Dozin followers had at coalition building, the attempts the Urzine had at coalition building with Waywardians and Metas and the establishment of non-factional organizations such as the Collective Cure Society and its dedication to cleaning Prospect Space of the Cancer along with various pan-Prospect media complexes.
   
**Part Fifteen-Alpha: The Mediator Wars- A Study in Multipolarity**

The current era has been distinct from prior eras, in its lack of unipolarity or even the bipolar environments like seen in the Architect.  No Dominion that dominated Prospect Space, no Cobalt Ecumene, no lurid Custodian presence.  Initially it had seemed that this would quickly end, and indeed there had been centuries where one force seemed to be winning out.    

Initially it had seemed like the Pale Swarm would dominate until coalitions against them contained them, than it seemed like the Urzine had become dominant in Prospect Space until the Balch secession made them stumble just long enough for a pan-Dozinist coalition between the Bilethought, Glowing Swarm, Silver Legion and Mediators pushed Urzine advances towards Jiwar back.    

Than it seemed like the Mediator Gestalt had won out...  Until they back-stabbed the Bilethought and caused a sectarian war that continues to be waged.  One waged by proxy through the Collective Cure Society recruiting folks such as the Metasyndicate of all things.  The Mediator Gestalt still remains a powerful leviathan in Prospect Space, but is no super power and if they tried to conquer like the Dominion did, The Mediators would inevitably find another coalition as other would-be conquerers did.  Worse still, in the past couple centuries neo-wheelists of Mediator derision had manage to establish a society of their own as the An Appath.  A society whose marauders have continued to stress the many, many trade networks in Prospect Space that fester with space piracy constantly already.

It had been six centuries since the Custodian invasion ended.   The Composer looseness with tech trade had a leveling effect on the whole of Prospect Space.  How long that remains is hard to tell, but the current system is believed to be closer to its end than beginning if history is of any indication.  None of the systemic frameworks Prospect Space has had could last much longer than a thousand years and all it takes is some major game changing innovation or clever conquerer to break it all apart.  At the same time, such dynamic has yet to emerge.  

However, it has been noticed that the current Prospect in the past hundred years has seen much less ill will towards other Prospect Spacers.  A trend that started post-Dominion but expanded after the Mediators discredited themselves and the Hargonians rapidly got humiliated by the Urzine-Metasyndicate axis for even trying to be a major power.  Regional wars aside, the vitriol of the post-Custodian Prospect had mostly declined and migrations between the factions have increased once more.  Even the most ideologically fringe leviathans such as the An Appath, Balch, or Bilethought can boast of being cosmopolitan civilizations even if the dynamics of species hierarchy still somewhat exist even in the most ideologically egalitarian Prospect societies.  Those who seek a 'permenant' solution to species hierarchy have ranged from biocollectivists who want a universal hivemind- the kind of group that gets actively persecuted, to those who have been trying to assimilate everyone to a universal genome framework that has caught on regionally.  

**Part Sixteen: The post-Custodian Tech Booms**

Instead, let us discuss more Prospect Space history.  The Custodian invasions had proven there to be a critical need for new advancements in military and logistics technology.  Anti-particle weaponry had become common use, biosynthetic tech had new languages and grammars used that allowed for stronger regenerating alloys and nanotechnologies.  Gestalt minds on smaller scales had become widely employed to managed and monitor entire worlds.  Black holes were being experimented on.  Wormholes had been adopted from the Architect, as had various alloys which Ikeitans would find a grammar for integrating into their biosynthetic ship designs.    

These advancements it was believed, would make future potential invasions harder.  It was still common however, to have to infiltrate the Architect to keep track.  The Architect they knew to be more advanced than them in various ways still.  And it is hard to say if future attacks from the Architect, be it Custodians or some other Architect civilization will falter the way the Custodian Invasion did.  

These innovations also would factor the ongoing arms races between the leviathan societies which pervade the Prospect Space's volume that reached spans of nearly a billion colonized star systems by the present day.  That number can hide how of those billion systems, over two hundred million were sterilized from the Custodian invasions and half of these systems date back to the Dominion.  The growth is steady, but hardly breakneck in pace as recolonizing systems and developing them tends to take higher priority in recent times especially due to concerns of frontier coalition in the coming millennia.

**Part Seventeen: Outsiders of Concern**

One of the other major aspects of the modern Prospect is that it had come into contact with an upstart alien civilization hailing from Earth in the past few centuries.  What seperates these aliens is that they already had been interstellar, but had much only been an interstellar civilization for nearly eight centuries.  When the Prospect was being massacred, humans were figuring out rockets.  Contact with the Prospect had been weird, humans had awareness of the Prospect since the 22nd century and evidently had come across a Sprawl fragment and even another upstart interstellar species known as the Tikali.    

The insane coincidence of two species independently having interstellar travel seemed too freak a coincidence.  While it was known, of stuff such as the Sprawl, Architect and various other civilizations in the greater galaxy who developed space travel it had often been assumed rare.  

Still, more immediate concerns took center stage.  Humans were invaded by the Golden Swarm.  That led to humans seeing the Prospect with some justification as a significant danger to their own civilization.  They succeeded in ending the Golden Swarm and reducing it to disparate flocks that fester about their own region of space to this day.  However, interest in these 'Civics' as they became known was limited due to them not being anywhere near the central mass of Prospect Space.  While Prospect forces were able to reach them, it was a long journey.  Hyperspatial node systems developed after the Custodian invasion (read: adapted from Architect tech) proved heavily influential in contacting such upstarts.  

As to details on the Civic, that is a whole different history.  The Sprawl and Architect similarly are vast systems of civilizations who deserve their own series of histories not even considering more obscure groups such as the Clogging Soul or Phidians.      

**Part Eighteen: Misc. Thoughts**

One may note that is an insignificant amount of star systems compared to the hundreds of billions our galaxy has, not even a single percent of all stars in the galaxy have Prospect Spacer colonies.    

That is correct.  However, one must also not that due to the existence of FTL not every star war colonized.  Prospect Space was spread out.  Many red dwarves were initially overlooked and while sometimes they are colonized or used as a realm of refuge, often to this day go untouched by Prospect Space with its bias towards yellow and orange dwarf stars.    

As to where Prospect Space currently is, it's hard to fully say.  Much uncertainty exists from how a Civic originated society has been raiding the Prospect, arousing both curiosity and anger while the shadow war with the Architect in the past decades has been escalating once again.  And than the Civic's involvement remains unclear to even the Mediators and Composers.  Ethics mutations among the Composers have been known to be occurring, as is  there are examples of rogue Composers such as Kazzlehorf who in the past decade had flash cloned a single Fosskemian individual billions of times.  

However things advance, it does seem that the galaxy is becoming an ever bigger place and the multi-polarity of Prospect Space, the very engine of prosperity and advancement it currently is may prove a massive liability in the coming eras...
