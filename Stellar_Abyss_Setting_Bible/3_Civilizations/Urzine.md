<h2>Urzine</h2>

### Overview

The Urzine are known as the bioship empire, the Urzine fleet dominates many sectors and their ongoing struggle for dominion of the ecumenical defines the thinking of the fleets as does the hatred of god. The Urzine are a gloomy, cosmopolitan and paranoid civilization that manages to be both free and oppressed, both rational and irrational, both passionate and despondent. These contradictions are made worse by their systems of patronage and internal race conflicts encouraged by the very bioships who protect them from the madness of the other biomorphic civilizations, be it to protect their identity from the associated of the Mediators or the anarchy of the Metasyndicate.

### Beliefs

The Urzine fleets descend from a revolt against the historical Dominion and the following exodus, where they came over control of multiple planet bound species who they uplifted and over the generations came to the conclusion that god is evil after the Dominion committed a crusade against them and spread the cancer to their sectors, causing centuries of paranoia that go on to this day. The species they uplifted they view as co-equals in the suffering inflicted upon them and they have allowed various migrants to their part of space under the pretenses of a protection racket from the outside chaos that tried to seep in.

The contempt for god is something widely taught among those part of their civilization, the Urzine themselves hate worship of any sort and are privy to parade around corpses of other bioships just to make their point of how they die just like anything else.
Their system of trade is semi-open within their space, though lots of security measures are used once you get past them it’s a surprisingly open system for those who work within their borders. The Urzine tend to act as moderators to transactions and have specialized Urzine who handle all transactions as living banks. These bank Urzine are said to be the real power of their civilization, just due to how they embody the economic forces needed to build non-Urzine armadas and keep the blood flowing.
The culture of gloom comes from the cynical outlook perpetuated by the Urzine themselves that spreads across their worlds, that of the general insignificance of life and the deeply material nature of the universe and how even the fabric of space is something that is material. The gloom culture is caused by how most in their civilization are isolated mentally from each other due to the fear of thought contamination and assimilation. It is also due to how they are literal aliens to each other, with most infrastructure being asteroid or planetoid based.

Species supremacism is also very common, with some worlds being de facto for a single sapient species despite often having Urzine patronage- these same species supremacists tend to regard the Urzine as something separate and even positive. The Urzine tend to be viewed in a light akin to a pimp or a sugar daddy to the affairs of other species, these dependencies on Urzine bioships can be incredibly deep, with patron Urzines being common despite their disdain for worship. Often having an Urzine patron is viewed as a huge status symbol by the members of the Urzine Domain, much more so than having a spaceship. This patron system is layered within smaller scale systems of open trade within star systems and bulk transfer between star systems with populations and ecological products being the most common transferred goods.

### Structure

The Urzine within their fleet follow a structure of hierarchy, with primes leading fleets with their higher Urzines and lesser Urzines. The fleet hierarchy is often a product of how much power one proves to have, internal feuds for higher levels are common and regularly involve lesser populations and take on an almost comedic array of means from one on one duels to the death to starting a small war between the worlds they rope into their disputes or it could just be voted on by the fleets. There’s no set secession system beyond designated replacements and popularly voter urzine. This wasn’t always the case- the early Urzine had a rigorous meritocracy in place for their fleets that fell out of use.

The usual structuring on lower levels remains meritocratic and highly corporate, with mega organizations handling distribution of living products and this has led to huge inequalities of wealth and internal tensions due to the arbitrary restrictions in place often by Urzine regulators who exist to keep the system stable to some degree. They have their own private fleets that act under the local urzine’s control.

Infrastructure in their civilization is oriented around planetoids and dyson swarms, with Urzine fleets orbiting around the place doing whatever they want. Planets are not colonized much, being viewed as incubators at best and more often as places for supplies, the idea of going down to terraform a world is often not even considered despite having the tech to. Most worlds are without skies, with multi-layered cylindrical rotating habitats being the norm with different layers hosting different species and Urzine patrons orbiting the overall cylinder. This is the generic arrangement, there are cases where they are single layer worlds or weird cases where a planet ends up deeply colonized due to often capricious reasons by the Urzine who enable it.

Usually on smaller scales, freedoms are great as one can travel anywhere without worry but the Urzine are always present and you often have to go through them to get to other star systems or trade. Metasyndicate traders are loathed for their lack of regard for Urzine gatekeeping, but are somewhat tolerated on the outer regions of their space regardless.

### Demographics

270 billion Ikeitan Bioships
8% Usati
11.5% Yalilu
15% Vopson
12% Sarkic
8% Cyrawaloc
11% Taysnoddl
6% Virtuals
4% Ooloopoo
2.5% Phidian
10% Fosskemian
1% Human (largest known human diaspora in an alien civilization)
1% Other

The Urzine Domain is a population with 1.4 Quadrillion inhabitants, putting them in a comparable range to the Mediators, though the Mediators remain much more populous by comparison.
The Urzine Fleets consist of nearly 300 billion bioships, with millions in each star system. This sounds massive, but only when you do not account for how they are spread across thousands of star systems of the ecumene where a hundred billion sapient inhabitants per star system even in neutral zones is the norm.

### Tech

The Urzine Domain is a highly inventive civilization, having a vast arsenal of weaponry, armaments and means of tearing into the fabric of the space-time continuum itself. The Urzine ability to trail wormholes with their crafts is what has allowed them to prosper and be a threat to the Mediators, even as this tech fell into the hands of Vopson swarms to devestating results in earlier centuries- the Ikeitans retain uniquely ikeitan forms of the tech that allow for much more stability and control over the krasnikov tubes trailed by their warp system that they developed separately from the warp obelisks ancient Cyrawaloc had once depended on. Urzine warp tech is still widely coveted due to the infrastructure systems it enables and due to the antigravity applications that had been found for it, indeed ikeitan warp tech is comparable to the unique developments of the silent Imperium save for the ability to blink jump, which baffles even the ikeitans who have since obsessively tried replicating the tech not really fearing the custodians like the Mediators do as the Urzine are confident in their ability to fend them off unlike the human upstarts who played with fire.
Ikeitan biometallics are much more developed than Mediator biometallics, with metamaterial applications that allow for seemingly reality defying feats such as getting near stars to absorb their energy or adapt to all matter of crushing depths allowing ikeitans to dwell within gas giants just fine using micro-rift based comms to set ambushes. Rifts have been used as a bomb as well, opening rifts to ultra high pressure worlds or to space to explode highly pressurized habitats is common.
