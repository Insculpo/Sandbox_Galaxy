# The Estate

The Estate is a hierarchy society in all meanings of the word.  They're superhuman entities who view themselves as maintaining a total sense of humanity that was lost by the others.  They're deeply totalitarian in governance and use a vast network of social engineering and eugenics to hold in place the idyllic humanity that they view as being lost to the posthuman tide.  They're a deeply natalistic force as well, mass breeding and cloning is commonplace as is the transhumanism myth.  

They're sometimes viewed as a descendent of the modern west, though one would wonder how much that can be so with the distorted mix of various Indo-European and Dravidian dialects being effectively a whole new language- Estate Common Speech.  How constructed it is and how natural it is remains unclear, only that they somewhat are a potent force but hardly dominant.  A regional trouble more or less.  Still, they count as one of the major Civic powers for better or worse and their warfare with other human factions has made them loathed for "learning nothing" from the Vopson invasion.  The Estate isn't much a fan of alien life, but deals with them as needed in their minds.
