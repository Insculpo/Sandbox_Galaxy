# The Mush
ï¿¼
The Mush as a civilization has its origins in the chaos of the 2600's.  The stability of the tendril system which the Murk had spun apart in a flare of radicalism and hostility to the ancient order, in the wake of the annihilation their authority vanished.  They were left with anarchy, one that never ended as the Mush manifested in its place.  Clobbered within, vulnerable and degenerative, the Mush's politics have proven a notorious black box.  The ruling elites of this less stable order do not have any authority, with clans often isolating into personal machine armies.  There are also a wide range of very, very questionable ethics caused by the distorted, perverted outlook of various ideologies that took hold from the converts whose dissonance and slur of texts.  

This dysfunctionality is what makes their current region so anarchic- they exist in a anarchic semi-dark age state with numerous mass suicides and technophobic, reactionary forces taking over in many places while less ideological warlords occupy and rule many places, their duties to themselves before anything else.  The Mush is known to have deep fear and contempt of the Silent Imperium, and is very violent towards any of their recruiters.  They also have extreme belligerence against the Minavans and the 'rogue tendrils' in the fringes.
