### Overview

Thalis is a warm, oceanic world with a global ocean ranging from 20-30 km deep with a pressure environment where much of the simply strides atop the water with large bacterial mats and fly about the clear skies where clouds are mostly dispersed in a miasma of fog which gives the sky a purplish tint.  The striders must be wary of sea creatures below which are all to happy to prey on them.  Striders tend to be able to jump or fly as a result, while other groups simply stay in the sky.
