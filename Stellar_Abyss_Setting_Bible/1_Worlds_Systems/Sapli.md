### Overview

Sapli is an icy world much like Europa, located in not too far from Earth.  It is a rather advanced icy world due to being the size of Earth and having a moon system which has enabled advanced geothermal activity on it, much like all the others.

### Conglomerates

Conglomerates are Megacellular life forms adapted to the pressurized depths of subglacial seas, they are made of just a few dozen cells usually as each cell is as big as a chicken egg.    They connect to make a hydra-like critter able to swim independent of water flows to hunt for smaller cellular critters with a system of entrapping and distributive digestion so that all cells benefit from any catch.
