## Overview

Scaverkus is a highly desolate desert world that orbits around its parent star on a highly elliptical orbit.  Scaverkus is a low gravity desert world which on paper would have been dead by now.  However it has retained geological activity thanks to the tidal forces elliptical orbits provide.  Scaverkus is a hostile world.  One where 2 earth year seasonal cycles often have frigid desert.  With warmth within the sun’s grasp existing only for part of the year.  The life on Scaverkus blurs the lines of civilization animal existence.  For the hostility of Scaverkus is so great that numerous Scaverkian ecologies will cooperate on a seasonal basis.  For example, various Predator species are known to work with creatures they view as prey for common resources (mainly water), but only on a seasonal basis.  For instance, regional ecologies sheltered by dormant volcanic cave networks will collect ice to warm in the depths of caves they know will be thawed during the more vulcanic summers. 

Meanwhile, some Scaverkians hibernate, others exist only in the caves.  The surface of Scaverkus in the mid-seasons can get regional foliage.  Such environments lead to what are known as the Hoarding Seasons.  The Hoarding seasons occur between winter and summer.  It is also an instance of predator-prey seasonal cooperation, as these normally conflicting species have an unspoken agreement to work together in the Hoarding Seasons where the prey also happen to breed more often.  However, when the hot and cold seasons return the predators go back to hunting and the prey go back to hiding.

Pictured above is an independently developing entity geographically locked by large barren regions.  Regions that historically have only been traversed by migrating during their world’s version of “interglacials”.  Where earth’s ice ages allowed for arctic traversal, the “life ages” of Scaverkus allowed for relatively safe traversal across the equator.  Incidentally, two proto-civilizations happened to both be at the middle latitudes of the world.  Which was where life enjoyed environments more stable climate-wise until the long cycles ended that geologically brief island of stability.  Such is life on Scaverkus, in its endless grind.
