### Overview

Votaldi is a cold desert world with incredibly little water, but still able to hold a large biosphere due to all the water being underground, however deeply rooted network plants and all matter of yellow life is present on the world, mainly due to the high sulfur content of the atmosphere caused by the bacterial fumes from the super volcanic region.  It is a stark, desolate world that yet remains more habitat table than most even if the air smells horrid here- as there is oxygen to breathe due to the mixed oxygen and sulfur biosphere caused by more advanced sulfur breathing bacteria managing to survive an oxygen holocaust which was considerably weakened by the lack of oceans here.  Votaldi orbits a red dwarf, so the plants here are a deep violet usually and absorb both sunlight and waves of radiation from the flares.  Much of the life here has better radiation resistance than specimens seen around the K or G stars at comparable distances.
