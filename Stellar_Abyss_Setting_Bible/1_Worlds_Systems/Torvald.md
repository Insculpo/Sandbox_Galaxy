### Overview

The grey trees of torvald sprout from the bio heaps with the incredibly layered environment created by Torvald's low gravity and dense, EarthLike vegetation.  Torvald is a low gravity world with large Desert regions and dense forest regions, while mostly desert the world is notable for its mountain sized bioheaps which are the product of billions of years of fossils made from dead flora of much more erosion resistant materials to that of earth, equivalent to perhaps coral.  Though the trees here are primarily a mixture of autotrophic and lithotrophic, in thanks to how densely packed the forests can get.  Still, the build up is faster than the decomposition.
