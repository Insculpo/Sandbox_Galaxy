### Overview

Sakam is an acidic world filled with sulfuric acid and it is viewed as related to Fuedisar, though Sakam has an archipelago geography.  Sakam also is far more volcanic and sulfur has shaped the whole world, molding it into smooth terrain and crystal deposits mixed with a vast range of colors caused by the varied cooling of the molten sulfur volcanism.  For this is a world with a sulfur heavy upper mantle.  Life here tend to be violet in color or shifts in colors to camouflage among the splattered terrain of the world.  The life here has very latex or rubber-like skins and there is no actual flora equivalent- the "plants" are temporary states for life on this world, transitioning between sea oriented larvae and sky oriented adults which have come to dominate this world.  Such metamorphic megafauna is everywhere on this world and in many shapes/forms.  Why life here is so land averse?  It is due to the lack of tides, as while the parent sun causes tides, they didn't play enough a role to make land oriented organisms instead of flying organisms the dominant ecological force.   Acidic life tends to melt and make use of digestion methods very different from ours due to everything already being acidic.
