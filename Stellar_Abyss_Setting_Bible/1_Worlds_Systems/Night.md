### Overview

The Night is am ocean world that froze over after it was ejected from its parent star from a nearby passing red dwarf.  It is an ocean that goes over 40 km deep in regions (with some places just a mere 5 km deep due to asteroid impacts and whatnot), iced over in a thick crust and kept alive by geothermal activity.  It is a world that has millions of years left for its biosphere, in that time the life used to hydrothermal gents and solar energy from above has managed to adapt to a far poorer existence, living within hotspot regions and migrating between desolate, freezing oceans to find where activity is.  And in these pocket ecologies, with pitch black life and massive cellular organisms, a vast range of pressure adapted organisms thrive without light.  Just hugging the rocky regions still around, even as the ice slowly creeps in its elevation and even as the heat slowly goes away- which it won't for another hundred million years due to the sheer size of the world.
