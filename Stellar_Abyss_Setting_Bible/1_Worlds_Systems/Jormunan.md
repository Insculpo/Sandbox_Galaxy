## Jormunan

## Overviewï¿¼

Jormunan is a GSA Client world that rose to some level of importance around 2745 when it became a GSA Client and major tourist destination.  For despite Jormunan being a very arid world that had marginal lithographic life at best, the artistic ventures and projects on Jormunan are vast and the clay filled desert with large plains and graphite outcroppings to many was like a blank canvas that the locals kept drawing on in earlier epochs.  As most live in orbit anyways, these activities went unhindered until illustrations filled almost the entire planet.  More elaborate art projects started to be taken up due to the tourism revenue it generated and what once was meant to be a world to be mined for resources became a massive center of the arts in the GSA.  With various media industries dominating affairs in the orbital cylinders and all matter of productions, sports and other industries being prominent on Jormunan as well.
