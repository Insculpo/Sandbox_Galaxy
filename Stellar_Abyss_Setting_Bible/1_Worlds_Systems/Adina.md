### Overview

The radiation rich world of Adina despite being small as mars has a gravitational pull as hard as earth.  Adina's density is also mixed with an atmosphere of rusted iron where dark orange seas and dark yellow skies are the norm.   Adina was stripped of its crust eons ago and has managed to develop life adapted to carbonyl.  Such life takes on magnetic properties and so many life forms have managed to hover on Adina, exploiting repulsion from the surface and using magnetic flux to kinetically sling themselves around the terrain or navigate the seas through energetic charges.  Life here also uses radio waves to stun prey, shout and even merely see by sensing other radio sources.  This is a biosphere where radio and magnetic forces permeate.  

### Ecology

The life here feeds mainly off solar energy and make use of energy vampirism, never devouring prey and often simply sucking their energy out or sapping it to farm it.  Transferring energy directly instead of needing metabolizing processes is a property distinct to metallic life, where body systems have more in common with machines at times despite following Darwinian evolution.  They still make use of many organic components however, such as their rubber-like muscles and vibrant white plastics as a chitin equivalent.  Reproduction between different life here is at a similar diversity to our world.  Life on Adina is kept alive by Adina being in a binary system with a stony world bigger than Adina known as Sparfeld, yet orbits Adina more than Adina orbits it.  

### Adinian Alloys

Adina is host to various Adinian ultra-pure alloy systems found in the shadow of Sparfeld mainly.  Adinian minerals can be made into a special kind of 'crystalized' steel of a purity only found in this galaxy on worlds like Adina- and worlds like Adina are incredibly rare in the galaxy.  These purities are also caused by lithic bacteria within the allows whose excretment purifies the metals, having lithic bacteriums who live off the impurities in metal.  These purity germs indeed have been widely sought.
