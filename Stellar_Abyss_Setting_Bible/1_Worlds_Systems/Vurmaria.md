## Vurmaria

## Overview
ï¿¼
Vurmaria is a weird place.  And one of the more dissident worlds out there.  It is a world where the Rasuu, primitives shipped over from Prospect Space by mostly unknown means.  It is a strange situation, the cooperation of humans and Rasuu is peculiar needless to say.  The mutual cooperation has led to a colony where they interlace with each other in very bunkered up community networks on a higher gravity world.  The periodic heat not helping.  They were once part of the GAC but in 2826 seceded due to demands they stop working with the Rasuu.  The secession had led them to less effective tech, but this may be hard to believe.  The decades since their secession has led to them regressing technologically in many ways, with them bunkering up believing the GAC intends to invade.
