### Overview
Â 
Glisten is a desert world that is usually described as a massive io-like world that somehow developed intelligent life.  This is due to the atmosphere being terraformed by the unlikely occurrence of bacteria that converted sulfur oxides to oxygen.  The acidic pools that are regional are surrounded by sprawling volcanic planes and super volcanoes, which such massive eruptions being periodic and causing regular mass extinctions.  

Yet in this chaos, Glisten has managed a diverse biosphere that has managed to make use of lithotrophic properties.  For Glisten life is very dry and built into the rocks themselves, sifting and shifting with them and modifying them towards clusters and colonies to improve their own food consumption and energy use.
