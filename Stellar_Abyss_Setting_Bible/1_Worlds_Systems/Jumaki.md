## Jumaki

Jumaki is a major Urzine Domain world with with a significant population of Yalilu as part of it.  They're notable for being a successful case of rapid arcology colonization even if the later structuring phases of colonizing Jumaki had led to stagnation overall.  They are seen somewhat with deep suspicion by other parts of the Domain due to rumors of religious cults being fostered there by the local Ikeitans.  However until Fester Agents confirm it, no action by the Urzine fleet has been taken yet.  And ideally this is never, as that usually and near inevitably means an orbital bombardment.
