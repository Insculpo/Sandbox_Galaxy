## Gilizet (The Hidden Flesh)

## Overview

Gilizet is a Sprawl world lost to space and time, with a couple tenuous open wormholes this outlying colony of the greater sprawl network being dominated by various factions of degenerative communities who only know the city they live in.  Gilizet's surface activity compared to some sprawl planets is relatively weak as the inhabitants went underground.

Gilizet's gravity well is weaker than earth, but the atmosphere's broken weather machines have made it a thick, stormy hell to land on making it a need to find a way underground.  Some surface structures still remain and drone activity is rather widespread, though highly scattered.  

The arid wastes host vast ruins of a much vaster city world obliterated in an ancient, ancient conflict.  The inhabits within don't really know or care to know much about said conflict as they lacked the ability to really connect with the past anymore.  The state of their kind was terminal.  Once the galactic hegemon, now but scavengers and warlords.

The surface is dotted with ways to access the depths in general, with long shafts leading to cities the city on the surface was built upon and eventually to the remaining livable regions of the world.  Wormholes to other worlds may well exist still, they used to have millions of them on this one world on the fringes of their empire alone.  

These access ways are often guarded by automata, but they are rather dysfunctional and easily outwitted or gamed by the standards of most security.  Indeed the reason no one ever got here in the intervening time is out of luck.  However some group of nomads stumble upon them, noticing something a bit off about this lost world.
