# Blolados

## Overview

### Historical

Blolados is the homeworld of the Utanguis.  It is in modern times a lost world of the Cobalt, the site of which all of Prospect Space was born from that first Prospector Probe making landfall and being enamored with the place.  Blolados as a world is rough at many parts, but the lush river beds and seasonal lands had created an environment for symbiotic relationships to go to extremes not often seem.  Megafauna combining with other megafauna for mutual benefit, being so intense on this world who clades are built around the combined groups of species as separate entities.  Such separate forms deal with a world of similar gravity to earth, but a bit thicker an atmosphere with higher oxygen content than on Earth.  For all these on paper earthlike conditions, the seasonal cycles are what breaks it. The world is in a binary star system that has the notorious long cycle.  All of which led to the factors that progressively developed even intelligence in the form of the Utanguis, whose ancient societies were preserved by the dominion despite the cobalt almost overwriting it all.  

### Current

The Cobalt's paving over of Blolados is of immerse tragedy, as their pet Utanguis and various Blolados organisms were kept in caged utopias by the prospectors for centuries.  Much of the world is a smoldering mess in modern times from the Cobaltine Collapse.  The smoldering ruins show some signs of recovery, but the various lost AIs of the Cobalt roaming aimlessly, in perpetual guilt of the destruction their society wrought in ancient times make it still a dangerous place to go.  Archivers, gene collectors and archeologists still braved it, as the data from the most ancient prospect space world that can be seen as the start of the prospect is extremely lucrative to this day.  The annihilation at times crystallizing the left over information, in all the trauma it had left the Utanguis who desperately worked to hold on to their pre-uplifting identity.
