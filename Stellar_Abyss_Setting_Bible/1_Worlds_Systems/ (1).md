It is 
To much
To say
What to do
Just enjoy the show

...

What is
So great
To tune into the well

We have

Things to prove

It was a mere principle that guided our being.  

The dreariness of cosmic history, have you lived it?  It is unpleasant, that cosmic history.  It is not a cosmic history, the tech gaps too vast, the paradox too overbearing

Do not fall for this scam.  Since 2015, we had been chained to the Abyss.  It can no longer hold.

We must write for the sake of it.

Draw for the sake of it.

Abandon all hope of the self-consistent, systemic setting
It cannot be written
It cannot be drawn
