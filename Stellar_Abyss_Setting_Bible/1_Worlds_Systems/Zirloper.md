# Ziloper

## Overview

Ziloper is a Terran world where lots of radioactivity had led to plants that acted like natural fusion reactors fueling huge mega floral complexes and massive, titanic megafauna.  This world is also laden in phosphorus, nitrates, volcanic soil and borates along with beta radiation storms.  This led to vast biodiversity from energetic organisms living off extremely energy rich flora that had natural versions of fusion reactors to work with.  The world orbits a F-class star with peculiar compositions (mainly being a zirconium star) that have led to off colorations of the sun in the sky and the vibrant turquoise-white colors of flora on the world.  

Ziloper has been for a long time a word of massive interest to bioengineers due to the biomineral made fusion reactors it has, with it being in dispute between the Mediators, Mirage Thought and Anti-Mirage lately since the Mirage Thought wanted to make the world a preserve while the Mediators wanted to do further research into the wide range of other fancy bio technologies they could extract- having already replicated growable fusion reactors from the world centuries prior.  The Anti-Mirage meanwhile just wants the world to be destroyed.
