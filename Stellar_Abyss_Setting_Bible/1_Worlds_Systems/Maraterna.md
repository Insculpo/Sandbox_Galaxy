### Samala

Samala are massive, massive creatures that dwell in the depths of ocean worlds who feed off microbial mats, they migrate downwards to feed on other creatures.  Their large, thin flippers help them navigate the violent currents of the oceanic worlds and are frequently weaponized in mating battles and stream battles.  They're oriented in packs tend to be very hostile to anything that they view as disruptive to their migration trails, including other packs of samala who get in the way,  causing sea battles to break out to define new territories.  They will attack sea bases that get in their way as well.
