### Overview

Alkud is a somewhat cold, oxygen rich world with alkaline water whose ancient biosphere and moderate gravity well mixed with large land areas, dense, yet non-concentrated deposits of minerals (there isn't much geological activity on their old, thick crusted World) and soupy climate has allowed for a shocking array of creatures who are able to modify their own DNA at will (Or bioforming).  

These bioformers are a rare kind of life, as their DNA systems are much more peculiarly self modifying than our own, where we genetically select through reproduction.  These bioformers simply need to imagine their children differently to change their appearance and often radically so.  They blur lines between intelligent and stupid life, as intelligence varies a lot with them often having life that either replicates clones of themselves or makes many radically different forms from the same womb.  The mold ability of their biology would lead to the Hilbado.
